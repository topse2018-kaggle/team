 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows—Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.

The problem is that EFT doesn't show more of an effect than talking and tapping your arm or talking and tapping a doll.   

 :::Second, I think you're not being quite forthright when you describe the accupressure citations as """"controvert[ing] this conclusion"""".  In fact, you removed the last two and silently changed the other two.  If you want to change text that someone has already responded to, please use  and <\s>, like this, so it doesn't look like you're being sneaky.  This also looks like you're throwing in every citation you can find without reading or understanding them, hoping something will stick.  If you recall, I asked for one pdf and we're now at numbers 16 and 17 and you're just now learning what the issues are.  And, after taking a look, neither one of your new studies has anything to do with establishing the existence of """"energy systems in the body"""". 

 :::I'm not sure what to say at this point.  The most charitable interpretation I can come up with is that you're not reading what you're citing:  you're either cutting and pasting from google or some other source.  Alternatively you're reading all of these papers but have no understanding as to what they contain.  Either way, you might want to consider editing articles that better play to your strengths. 

 :::As to Feinstein's rejoinder:  it's available here.  This is an excellent lesson in tapdancing: 

 ::::[The studies he found] lend[] support for the efficacy  of tapping while mentally attuning to an emotional difficulty. Despite the design flaws found in some of the  studies, the preponderance of evidence shows energy psychology interventions to be efficacious. 

 :::The first sentence is true, but he neglects to explain why arm-tapping and doll-tapping have equal efficacy.  The second sentence equates talking and tapping with """"energy psychology"""" which has the additional baggage of energy fields that can evidently migrate to arms and dolls.   

 :::So after 18 citations what we have is the suggestion that a particular kind of talking associated with some sort of physical ritual can be more helpful than other treatments in some situations.  I would be comfortable including the two Feinstein reviews if the shortcomings pointed out in Pignotti are highlighted, and I think Waite (2003) deserves a paragraph.  I don't see an argument for including any of these other citations.  If you want to make such an argument, please be sure to read the citation first and be able to summarize how the citation supports the point you want to make.

 You wrote: 

 You will need to cite reliable sources for the assertions """"far too large to be chemical"""" and """"no endothermic storage events"""". I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point . . . 

 It is very easy to establish both points, and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them. 

 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. 

 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after.

 I'm sorry if I wasn't sufficiently clear.  

 On the specific subject of """"first serial"""" versus """"reprints"""" I have an interest because I write commercial fiction for a living. 

 I'm not saying a contract would contain a """"non-standard definition"""" of first serial, original, or reprint. 

 I'm saying that you quite clearly do not understand the *standard* definitions in publishing commercial fiction of first serial, original, and reprint. 

 """"Is"""" means the same thing in plain English as it does in intellectual property terminology. """"Reprint,"""" """"original"""" and """"first serial"""" mean much more specific things in intellectual property terminology than they do in colloquial English. 

 It may well be suitable to call a female crotch a vagina in a personal blog, but in an encyclopedia article talking about female genitalia, it matters that the colloquially used term is factually incorrect and the correct terminology should be used. If the correct terminology would be confusing to readers, then a hyperlink to a correct definition may be in order. 

 You are, by analogy, effectively insisting that a set of labia is a vagina. 

 (Sorry, clearest example I could think of where the commonly accepted vernacular term shouldn't be used in an encyclopedia article because it's wrong.)

 ==US== 
 I'm trying not to just be a whinger and a hand waver here, but it annoys me that there's an entire section devoted to left vs. right politics in the US, yet there's nothing similar regarding the rest of the world. The US bias of wikipedia is very irritating sometimes, though it shouldn't be, as most Internet users are in the U.S. In other words, i'm a whiny European who is too lazy to write a non US section. 

 From the US>  That's easy to fix.  Start writing more about non-US views on topics, creating topics, and  getting your friends to help.  Something that is created by users being called biased only reflects the predominant users posting and thus can easily be remedied. 

 Also from the US> No, it's NOT so easy to fix. Throughout Wikipedia you will see entries from (obviously) American authors who have no concept of a world view and automatically write from a US perspective without any attempt to qualify their language. What, therefore, tends to happen is that the US view becomes a default with international views living in ghetto-ized paragraphs.     

 Also from the US> That is actually kind of the problem with Wikipedia all around in the first place, and that is that popular ideas are not necessarily correct. You can have people posting information about the corruptibility of whatever organization, but then the organization can have its people change the entry the next day.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

  
 This entire dicussion lends a great deal of credibilty to the idea that the left-right spectrum poorly represents political and economic views.  It seems to me that most of the debate below is equivalent to attempting to define the square root of negative 1 with only real numbers at our disposal.  It is painfully obvious that politics is muli-dimensional.  The most that can be hoped for here is to describe how the left-right spectrum is used and leave it at that.  This should probably be a very short article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 == Better Chart == 

 I think that this page needs a metter chart. Like this one http://studentnewsdaily.com/conservative_vs_liberal_beliefs.shtml    

  
 Edit  

 I actually think that the article, in fact the whole political movement, needs a better definition of """"left-right"""". Most political parties cannot adhere to a single category, including revolutionnary movements and far-right groups, as described somewhere else in the discussion. 

 I suggest a new use of the """"left-right"""" compass. 

 The political compass uses the """"square"""" system with two axis  x and y (social and économic), which is not very accurate because I know my political ideas, and they tend to be pretty nearer to Mussolini than to Gandhi. Whatever. 

 What I suggest is a cube! 

 3 axis  x, y and z 

 Économic 
 Social 
 Politic 

 The first one defines the market system (if any) of a political group. 
 The second defines the social standing of a political group about the welfare of the people (welfare checks/charity, private/public school/medical system, etc) 
 The thirds one is, basically, the way a society treats it's people (rehabilitation/punishment, democracy/totaliratism (in which I include Soviet Communism!) etc)

"0042a95dc2b6a0a8",""":::ok Fadix says that I am loosing credibility. it seems that when ever someone comes and tells something else he looses credibility. let me introduce myself first I am new comer here and not (obviously) in any way professionaly involved in history studies (I have a PHD in Neuroscience). and not getting any money from the Turkish goverment. and I am not a Holocoust denying neo-nazi either.I just read the article because of the relatively new debate here in Germany(ok i will be honest I have a Turkish girl friend and I am interested in Turkish history. and now i am using her computer. Does that reduce my credibility, probably yes ha?). I am sory to give this description but I get the impression that i will soon be blamed of beeing a Turkish propagandist, goverment person, racist whatever. Am I too sensitive. No take a look at the discussion history and see that these accusations are there.    
 I am making clear points that any sane unbiased human cam make. First of all the article issues the Genocide as a fact! A fact but with still some discussions (most of them being from the Turkish goverment). This gives the inevitible impression that all issiue is largely accepted(final verdict). Yet it is not!!!  
 Secondly the term Genocide can only be used under certain conditions (as in the holocoust). in this case there is a real doubt if these conditions are met!!! still the article freely and carelessly uses the term just only because some people or countries recogonise it that way. Do we have the right to blame a nation with this ultimate crime just because of that??? Genocide guys this is no joke!!! tell it 100 times for 90 years and Turks are Genociders! Cool! 
 third: after building up the genocide idea The article mainly represents the opposing view as the view of the Turkish goverment as clearly described by the headings (the position of Turkey,the position of Turkish authorities, political issues) as well as the content. which inevitibly gives the impression that the opposing view is just bull S*** Turkish propaganda. But it is not! Many Prof. and researcher of the era say that it is not. (As seen in the attached letter). yet fadix wrote that these prof were actually accepting the genocide they were fooled in to this (quoting Israel Charny). this is ridiculous. I dont know who the hell is Israel Charny or he really claims something like that. But please we are not stupid people. this was a letter to the representatives and these people who signed it are Profs. for gods sake!!! also If these prof were in favor of the genocide and really fooled in this conspiracy later they would have said """"ok guys I am misslead and fooled into this"""" and this would be the ultimate tool for Armenian side too ridicule and discredit the Turkish side. Is it the case? No!(so fadix what about credibility) 

 I am not bitching anyone. I am not using citations and names to blurr peoples mind. if you read my previous adds you will see that i am trying to use a carefull language. I am sorry again if I used harsh words. But after reading the long history of discussion in this page I have the impression that Fadix (who seems to be the main edittor in this page)has a certain attitude towards the issue and despite serious oppsition now and in the past he is just pushing the article his way.  

 ok Fadix I believe in your good faith. I am a dumb ass who doesnt know any thing about history .please give me answers. I am just asking plain, crystal clear questions. I dont want to hear citations, dates and historian names. just logical anwers!! Just logical answers which will show that you are unbiased!!! Or you may choose to say I believe in Armenian genocide and that is why I chose to ignore... 

 1. how can you use the nomenclature or lets say the word """"genocide"""" so easily knowing that it is desribed and only can be declared by international law. also knowing that there is robust objections to the usage of this term. Are you the ultimate expert. Are you the head of an international court?(if yes where is self defence?)  ((you say Go try finding such a section in the Cambodian genocide article, the Nanking massacre article, Rwanda genocide article. I could not see a Cambodian genocide article, in Rwanda genocide: United Nations set up the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, so the guild is described by law. Nanking massacre is a perfect example!!! why is it not called a genocide but massacre? is it because the guilt is not described by law??!! and in the discussion there is no real objection to the issue accept the numbers) 

 2. why does the article present the genocide as a fact? (I hope you wont tell that it doesnt). why do you build up the article so that people are first instructed that there is indeed a genocide and only later show the objetions. 

 3. why is there no data about armenian gangs killing muslims and raiding villages before and after 191"

 == Revision of a paragraph in mind-body section == 

 The following paragraph appears in the section on mind-body problem 
 ::Incompatibilism requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Although  substance dualism offers such a distinction, a less extreme form of naturalism known as non-reductive physicalism may also suffice. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states correspond to neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, although physical states do cause mental states, they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events supervene on physical events, describing the emergence of mental properties as correspondent to physical properties. This relationship is known as causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism, yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states - such as epiphenomenalism. 

 I understand the urge to recast the preceding discussion in a form more similar to the rest of the article. But I don't find this paragraph, although superior to its predecessor, has quite made the grade. I'd like to try to do this in a manner reverse to that of the paragraph; that is, go from the simple viewpoint to the technical rather than vice versa. A single paragraph won't do it. Here is a possible substitute (please take it as a suggestion to be tinkered with): 
 ::One may choose as a starting point the point of view that mind and matter constitute different things. One may then take several views about how or even whether they interact. At one extreme there is no interaction at all. At another extreme, mind completely controls matter or the other way around. In between, one may say mind and matter each influence each other to a degree, in some cases one is more in control and sometimes the other. 
 ::We might attempt to establish which of these choices is best, but that seems to be out of reach at the moment. Instead, we will simply connect these possibilities with various identifying labels of historical importance.  If one takes the extreme view that mind completely controls matter, or vice versa, in effect the controlled aspect is simply an appendage of the controlling aspect, and may be considered simply as a property of the controlling aspect. The two substances are then simply one, albeit perhaps with some additional attributes, and this viewpoint is called monism, which takes on several forms as described in that Wikipedia article.  
 ::An example, is epiphenomenalism, that mind is just a peculiar side effect of matter. Thomas Huxley described the relation between mind and matter as follows: 
 :: 
 ::Huxley goes on to say he sees no difference from humans in this regard. Very similar to this point of view is reductive physicalism adopted by some neuroscientists: 
 ::{{quote|...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells... |Eric R. Kandel|In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind}} 
 ::The view that mind and matter are different is called dualism, and it again takes on several forms described in that Wikipedia article. Within this description are various degrees of control of one entity over the other, ranging from complete autonomy of one or both entities, to some degree of interdependence. Considerable interest attaches as to what forms of interdependence might arise. 
 ::For example, even if mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states bear some correspondence with neurological states. Under non-reductive physicalism, physical states do cause'' mental states, but they are not ontologically reducible to them. In one such construction, mental events exhibit emergence from physical propertie"

 == Religion == 	   

 One thing which I have heard numerous times and which is not explicitely stated in the article is that the US """"way of living"""" religion is often seen as Freedom of religion, but not freedom from religion: one can chose any religion he wants (preferably a variant of Christianism  and preferably a variant of protestantism if one wants to have fair chances to obtain high positions), but atheism, or even agnosticism, are not well tolerated. 	   
  	   
 This is especially observable when wealthy evangelists from the USA go on their """"evangelisation"""" trip to Europe and start talking about religion to people in the streets, a subject widely regarded as very personal. 	   
  	   
 I don't know how this could fit in the article though (I'd rather discuss this here before).   	   
  	   
 :Are you American? I ask that because it sounds like you have the common """"I've heard America is this way"""" idea. I'm an American, live in a nice city with many friends in different social classes and with different backgrounds and I would say that religion is totally on the back-burner with people choosing whatever they like and not dropping it on others. I personally feel religion is for the most part a crock, and when I discuss that fact I get a wide variety of replies and thoughts, but nobody is trying to convert me. If I see a televangalist on TV I just turn the channel, no big deal. Now as far as the midwest gos, I can't really speak from experience but my idea is that the US as a Christian fundamentalist factory is WAY overblown in the foreign press. We get sterotyped as a caricature of what we are...like when you get a charcoal sketch of yourself at the beach and the guy draws your ears really big and has your head all mishapen to highlight your features, way overblown! I could say that I don't like all the German shit-porn videos that I know they are really into and that I should include a section on the Germany page about fecal-defecater-porn because it is so prevelant in their society when really that is kind of a personal thing, but I realize that Germany really isn't THAT into filming themselves shit on each other and I know it is an overblown viewpoint of Germans in America. Does that go too far to make a point? Sorry if I offended any Germans, totally for explanation sake ) Anyway, we need a rebuttal section first that highlights the fact that some of this is misconception propogated by ignorance of Americans and religous extremism too   	   
  	   
 ::Rama is perhaps unwittingly revealing a major root of anti-American sentiment abroad. Ignorance.   |   	   
 
 ::: I don't say that this is true exactly the way it is shown on some media. Just that lots of people percieve it this way, and that some traits in American Weltanshaung confort this perception. The """"In God we trust"""", swearing on the Bible, religious proselytism abroad and other punctual details like this can give an overall impression which is the subject of the article.  """

I suspect that whoever wrote that bit had no idea what he was talking about.  

 I find the whole entry for theocracy completely unsatisfactory, starting with the definition. Again, it reads as if the writers had no idea about the subject and have it confused with several other topics. I think it would be hopeless to try to repair the page by successive edits. It needs to start with a proper definition of theocracy that distinguishes theocracy from caesaropapism and clearly says that a pious society is NOT by definition a theocracy, and also that church establishment is not compatible with theocracy, but is compatible with caesaropapism. Theocracy is a form of government, not a social quality, it can be defined as """" """"a government in which the persons and institutions of the religious order either control or replace the organs of the civil government."""" (Sen McGlinn, Church and State, page 243).  

 Then it is clear that Iran is a theocracy, Saudi Arabia is not, and so on through all the other questions discussed here. The problem is a vague and too broad definition at the outset. One should rather start with a clear and hard definition, and later note that in popular usage the term has become an almost meaningless pejoritive applied to religion in public places.  

 Can somebody enlighten me about how one goes about fixing the page? One obvious step would be to ask for input via the editors of the Journal of Church and State (Baylor University, they have a research school on this topic). Email me at Sen.sonja [at] Casema.NL - Sen McGlinn ]]

 ::I am not asking that the article itself draw any conclusions, and the rest of your remarks are exactly the kind of synthesis that I desire. My remarks are meant to move us past the conflict on the talk page. Our sources are, of course, the verifiable secondary sources, and we are not to do original research. As CTSWynekan has said, Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Frankly, it's enough for me that the various Christian views are presented fairly and accurately, the various Jewish views are presented fairly and accurately, the various historical views (whether by specialists or nonspecialists) are presented fairly and accurately, and all other views are presented fairly and accurately. All should be given the appropriate weight and context. That is enough of a synthesis for me.  
 ::But, we all have our subjective views, and many of our views have clashed, hence we have been bogged down in one paragraph for far too long. What bothers me is the binary thinking evidenced by some (many, not all), which has polarized the debate. We should also, of course, be sure not to confuse our various subjective viewpoints with the objective actual, verifiable and factual (as someone once said). So in the end, I essentially agree with you. My remarks on thesis-antithesis-synthesis and the rest have to do with the debate on this page, not with the article itself. I want us to move past conflict so we can examine the verifiable sources, and put aside our own views while still making sure that we (any """"we"""") are accurately represented, as are the views of others. To paraphrase Ross Perot, everybody stop fighting and get to work! If you'll check you'll notice that I've done very little work on the article itself; most of my efforts have been focused on the talk page. 
 ::NPOV (when we reach it) will be a synthesis accurately reporting the views of all, and referenced to the appropriate verifiable sources.That said, I have been as frustrated as anyone else and needed to vent my spleen (which perhaps presented my POV more strongly than I have in the past. Does that make it trinary?). My spleen has been vented. My comments will remain on my user page at least until we formulate a second paragraph that does exactly as you say, and is accepted by all. It may go back if we run into further unresolved conflict.

 == Why is this article not called """"Republic of China""""? == 

 In the Macedonia name dispute a vote was taken that ignored the provisional UN name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The rationale given for this is that Wikipedia does not conform to international bodies and that self-determination of name trumps regardless of international disputes between states. Ergo - why are the people of the Republic of China held to a different standard? This inconsistent logic smells of prejudice towards either  the people of Taiwan and/or the people of Greece. I therefore propose that this article be renamed Republic of China to keep things consistent.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

  
 A few points I'd like to add. 

 # The People's Republic of China recognizes the self-determined name of Republic of Macedonia. 
 # The People's Republic of China does not recognize the self-determination of the Republic of China (Taiwan). 
 # The US government, did not recognize Republic of Macedonia in 1944 (the US state department at the time calling it """"communist demagoguery"""") but flip flopped in 2003 and now recognizes it. 
 # The US government, orginally did recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan)  right up until it flip-flopped and removed recognition in the 1970s. 

 This opens up the secondary question is Wikipedia taking a principled approach on international issues or simply parroting the current foreign policy of leading nations? (i.e. mob rule)  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 : For the reasons given here: Talk:Taiwan/Archive 20. A lot of discussion so a lot of reading, but if you're interested in the issue I think well worth reading at least the highlights of it.  

 :: For the same reason that we have North Korea not the 'Democratic People Republic of Korea' and we have Burma not the 'Republic of the Union of Myanmar'. It is policy to use the common English name. Not the official name; not the UN designated name; not the preferred name of the local people; but the common name as used by English speaking people to describe the subject. See WP:Naming Conventions for more information about how article names are decided on Wikipedia.    

 ::: Naming this article 'Taiwan' does not contribute clarity. Titling the article 'Taiwan' may lead the reader to belief that such a country as 'Taiwan' exists, or that 'Taiwan' can be equated to the 'Republic of China', which are both invalid arguments in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. The fact is that no country called 'Taiwan' exists, and that the 'Republic of China' cannot be casually associated with 'Taiwan' as historically they are very distinct entities. It also contravenes the rules for Wikipedia's neutral POV rules, as it promotes the DPP's assertion that Taiwan should edge toward independence by increasing the usage of 'Taiwan' without officially abandoning the 'Republic of China' name. It is for the sake of objectiveness that the official name should be used. See: WP:Neutral point of view   
 ::::Again see the requested move, where this was debated in long detail to arrive at the current title, best representing consensus and common usage. The article is Taiwan reflecting the common name for the country.  

 :::::Thank you  for your clarification on this matter. I agree that this article should be named Taiwan for the sake of clarity to English speakers in Wikipedia. However, I believe that it should be made clearer that the Republic of China is not equivalent to Taiwan.

 ==The accusations have profoundly effected his life, therefore are notable and deserve inclusion.== 
 The facts have moved past debating whether there really is a love affair or a love child, its on to how this is hurting John Edwards. I guess someone researching him would just have to wonder why his political career suddenly sputtered the summer of 2008, wiki won't mention what everyone else is writing long stories about. 

 Its probably ended his career in politics. Whether the story is true or false or not is debatable, and it doesn't matter if you don't like the original source, leftist wiki editors protecting Edwards: the story now is how the allegations are damaging him and have already probably lost him any chance at his best chance at furthering his career: the VP slot. Its an important story, its an important fact that his behaviour has caused a firestorm. Suppressing the story _completely_ is making wikipedia a laughing stock. Gawker, Mickey Kaus, countless bloggers are going on about it and pointing to it as proof of wiki's leftist bias. You aren't really hiding anything anyone doesn't know already, and you're making the site you claim to be protecting look stupid.  

 Its noteworthy, very much so. Its verifiable that the scandal, true or false, is affecting his career (many people have been hurt by scandals that turned out to be false, that doesn't make the news of the damage any less noteworthy). It has innumerable sources as to the effect on Edwards' career. Its time to lift the blackout and start debating on the wording of a section about it. You can't avoid it forever. Are you just trying to bluff it out until the election is over in hopes of minimizing any tangential damage you think it might cause Obama?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :Is it really a surprise that people are fighting to get the truth posted on Wikipedia? I recently had to deal with the Nazi admins on Wiki and let me tell you, I could honestly say they act like a bunch of kids in the movie """"Lord of the Flies"""". The majority of them will not listen to reason and when you present them with facts they disregard them. There is also no one managing this site from the top who gives a crap about what is going on here. The only way the owners of Wikipedia will challenge a Nazi admin is when it involves legal action. Wikipedia is the anti-Christ of the internet. Also a majority of the Nazi admins are liberals and the only way to become an admin is to be voted in by another liberal Nazi admin. Once again, """"Lord of the Flies"""". Just wait and see. I will be hounded by many of them for posting just this little snippet. Its pretty much a given. They will probably ban my IP or kick me off the site for a few days. If they dont like what you are saying, that is what they do. They pretty much do what they want. Pretty pathetic.    

 :: It is obvious that there is a calculated effort by the mainstream media (MSM) to suppress any information about this story. The MSM has jumped on stories with much less to go on than this Edwards story. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the MSM, and the liberal websites like Wikipedia, won’t talk about the bad things that happen in the Democrat party because it is the party and ideals that they personally believe in. It is human nature to not attack yourself and the Democrats will not attack themselves by talking about Edwards cheating on his wife who is dying of cancer. This is a silver bullet for the Democratic Party especially because there is a presidential race going on. Why do you think the MSM sits on stories until months or weeks before an actual election takes place? It is a new phenomena occurring in the MSM where they run a story with little facts in an effort to smear a person (typically a politician) then they let the people decide if they want to believe it. This usually occurs with little or if any facts to back it up. All the major networks do it all the time. A perfect example is the Dan Rather forged documents story about President Bush. They unleashed the story with little to no facts right before a Presidential election. It’s very sad that more of the American people don’t see what the MSM to trying to pull off right in front of their eyes. I am not an avid listener of Rush but I have caught him a few times and there is absolute truth to the term he uses when referring to the MSM, """"Drive-by Media"""".

 This is minor, but Louis' mother is forced to take a boarder - more accurate than """"humbles herself"""" which is also clunky. 

 """"Unimpressed by his prospects, Sibella turns down his proposal and instead marries Lionel (John Penrose)"""" is firstly an assumption and casual (ie. """"turns down""""). This: After being rebuked by an now adult Sibella and witnessing her marriage to Lionel (John Penrose) is more formal and 100% accurate. 

 """"At his workplace, Louis has to wait upon"""" is clumsy, but there can be a modification that incorporates the best of both.  """"A darkroom explosion makes her a widow"""" is simply unnecessary and casual in tone. This can also be modified. You've also missed the viewing of the remaining family at the church. 

 That said, there are some improvements, such as the fatal boating accident and the letter of condolence.

 The  Holocaust  

 The holocaust occurred during World War II when Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany. The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazi’s. However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country.  This reminds me of how Ms. Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event. But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did.  

 Therefore, a network of over 40,000 facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate, hold and kill Jews and other victims. In addition after the beginning of WWII, the Nazi’s began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren't allowed to leave at all. Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death, but the Jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitler’s orders. Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non-Jewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas. In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos, concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps, and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren't respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler. Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazi’s blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country. 

 Anne Frank Diary 

 Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust. She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary. I believe that she had a messenger, to tell her what was going on outside. Anne Frank was born in June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany. She was born as a Jew, and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the 1920’s because it was during World War I. She was hiding because herself and her family didn't want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place. I don’t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? Why hurt the Jews? What did they do to get killed? 

 Change of the Freedom Writers 

 Should It’s amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded. From a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story. They didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed. Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach. Many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation. They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School. The reason why, is because it was then when it all started. From failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to SUCCESS. For the most part, most of them are doing very well. They are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. They are living the toast of change.

"00a02064e4c420d3","==Identity of monarchs?== 

 The article on Arbella Stuart mentions — but does not identify by name — a Duke of Parma, a Pope, a cardinal who was the Pope's brother, as well as the kings of France, Spain and Poland. I want to identify and make links for the Pope, cardinal and kings mentioned in the article. 

 My sketchy memory of the names of European leaders of the late 16th and early 17th centuries makes me ask these questions: 

 :Is the King of France Henry IV? 
 :Is the King of Spain Philip III? 
 :Is the Pope Clement VIII? Did he have a brother who was a cardinal? Was that cardinal really defrocked in order to marry Arbella Stuart? 
 :And who are the Duke of Parma and King of Poland mentioned in the article? 

 I would appreciate someone who knows more about the period to find out and add the appropriate links to the article. Many thanks.

 == Sleeper (Woody Allen film) == 

 In view of its creator and star, Woody Allen, the movie Sleeper is satire of trends of the 1970s placed in a futuristic setting. I'm giving as an anachronism a reference to a historical event (the abandonment of clerical celibacy by the Roman Catholic Church) in which a character finds a 1990 newspaper that refers to the """"wife of the Pope"""" having children. Such would not happen for at least 24 years after the time suggested in the newspaper.   

 Nobody says that this movie is orthodox science fiction (note that tobacco and junk food have been found wholesome and organic foods have been found harmful in an Orwellian world), but a reference to a 1990 event that is shown to be impossible because a prediction of an institutional change that does not happen for a significant time later becomes an anachronism after 1991.

 Hi Pburka. You don't know me but I just wanted to say thank you for this comment you made at AN/EW regarding 155blue's edit warring report against me (for edits on my own talk page). Believe it or not, she also reported my supposed edit warring at the vandalism noticeboard, which of course was quickly dumped. She has apparently been educated several times about what vandalism is, but she continues to falsely accuse (and report) other editors of it. And she ignored me when I educated her about WP:3RR and WP:NOT3RR. I see that she also issued you a bogus warning just above this thread (without a signature, yet again). She doesn't know the difference between WP:PROD and WP:AFD, which doesn't surprise me because she warned me about moving a """"warning"""" - on my own talk page, no less - that was actually a template. The most concerning issue, though, is that she only has 300 or so edits - most of them in the past four months - and has shown a pattern of of rashly issuing warnings to, and filing reports at various noticeboards about, editors. Even very experienced ones, like yourself. This pattern of hers seems to indicate that she prefers to go straight to noticeboards instead of having proper discussions with editors first, even though some of the editors are vastly more experienced than her and the allegations are flawed. Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for the very on-point comment you made.   """

Second, you've been here only a short while, and NACs of AFDs are controvsial enough when it is a highly experienced editor (the policy actually discourages it, but doesn't ban it).  While it might seem obvious that it was going to be kept, experience will show that often an AFD will have a dozen keeps and no deletes, then after a CheckUser gets involved, we find those were all the same person, for instance.  This stuff really happens.  Even in cases where the votes are all legitimate, it doesn't hurt to wait, and of course, when there are issues such as vote stacking or any controversy, no non-admin should close.  Admin aren't smarter than non-admin, but we are expected to take the heat and are accountable for dealing with problems like this.

"00c046cb3a07cd38","A few questions that need resolving regarding this article 

 1) Why the inclusion of the actions of individuals? Surely the point of corporate behaviour is that it is the action of a corporation in itself, although these actions may not always be the intended ourcome of any individuals involved. Furthermore whilst the effects of corporate behaviour on individuals may be a useful sociological side effect I do not see this as central to the issue of corporate behaviour. 

 2) I think an explicit division needs to be made between business/capitalist corporations and noncapitalist corporations (NGOs, charities etc) as I think the proposed rules of corporate behaviour can only be seen to apply to capitalist corporations. 

 If no-one disagrees with this would people like me to attempt these changes (removal of references to indiviudals, creation of distinction between business and non-business coporations)?

 The discussion here has ruled against the use of this content:  

 """"Women of the (East) German wartime generation refer to the Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park, Berlin, as the """"tomb of the unknown rapist"""" in response to the mass rapes by Red Army soldiers in the years following 1945."""" 

 The discussion above established: 

 :The art of truth-telling about authoritarian rule‎ - Page 70 - the only thing that shows is """"Locals refer to it as: The Tomb of the Unknown Rapist. Source: Anders Thorsell""""  what locals? what city? This is not verification for this or any other article. For all we know it is referencing an American Vietnam War memorial. The inclusion of this reference is pure WP:OR and I will dispute it being included, as to include it is a gross violation of WP:V and WP:OR. 

 :The rise and fall of the German Democratic Republic, 1945-1990‎ - Page 10 - states """"[ ] East Berlin's Treptow Park, painful memories were reflected in references to it as the 'Tomb of the Unknown Rapist'.12"""" - what is *12 referencing? What is before the beginning? i.e. [ ]. For all we know it is referencing """"Jokes from the Soviet Period‎ - Page 42"""" - jokes are inappropriate encyclopaedia references 

 :Making Up Meanings in a Capital City: Power, Memory and Monuments in Berlin (from [13]) - states """"... heavy weapons, has historically received rather more attention from the local population, attracting the epithet ‘tomb of the unknown rapist’ or ‘tomb of ...""""  one can assume (i.e. engage in original research) that this is referring to a monument in Berlin, and even if one was to assume correctly it was talking about a monument in Berlin, there are THREE Soviet war memorials in Berlin, and as there are also other War Memorials in Berlin (US, UK, etc), it is original research to link it to this memorial and as per the first ref above, I will continue to dispute it's inclusion in this article, again as a violation of WP:OR. 

 :Again, as this is obviously a fringe term, evident by the non-existence of sources, one of which is a joke book, and also because one of those sources claims that a Soviet war memorial in the British sector also has this """"nickname"""" (this of course being Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten), as it is in the former British sector of Berlin), there is enough concern as to editors using Google searches as a means of adding unverified information into articles, that it is in the best interests of this article to remove those sources. Remember, the WP:BURDEN is on editors inserting material into articles to verify information, and as clearly laid out above, it is impossible that the editors have verified it before inserting into the article; otherwise the requested cites would have been forthcoming

 Hi. Sorry if I'm doing this wrong but I'm not familiar with the way discussions are handled in Wikipedea. 

 You deleted a modification I made to the Supreme Commander article which I disagree with. Diff link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Commander_%28video_game%29&diff;=653602714&oldid;=653594367  

 I replaced a link to the discontinued official website with a link to the fansite that currently supports the game. You subsequently deleted my modification and replaced it with a link to the Wayback Machine page that attempts to load the old official website. 

 I don't think your modification is an improvement. Everytime I've tried it the Wayback Machine page you've linked either loads a blank page or reports an error in Robots.txt, it's never once loaded an actual archived page. (Tested in Firefox 35.0.1 and IE8 64bit). 

 The fansite I linked is currently the hub for the entire Supreme Commander communty. It is the only remaining source of bugfix patches, and it is the only multiplayer matchmaking lobby for the game which averages a population of 800-1000 members nightly and thousands of matches played. For someone visiting this article for information on Supreme Commander I think they will get far more value from the link that I posted than from the one you posted. 

 I've looked at the Wiki article guidelines and I don't see anything that prohibits fansite links for games that are no longer officially supported. (This game isn't just no longer supported the producer has actually gone out of business). I note that the article on the original Elite contains links to both the FrontierAstero website and the Elite Wiki at alioth.net both of which are fan maintained resources."

In Florida, a jury is able to recommended a life sentence instead of death.

 :::::That is not what I meant. If my life were hanging in the balance, I would much rather put it in the hands of a judge. This should never have been a death penalty case.  Not enough evidence to meet the criteria.  A jury is too unpredictable.  Most of the time, the defense team thinks about how much money they will make and the publicity they will get - which is also about money, and lastly, they think about the defendant.  To the prosecution and the judge, it is about the truth and the proof.  Of course the defense team would not want a bench trial.     
 ::::::It would be best if we stay on topic then as our common goal here is to improve the article; opinions that you'd rather face a judge yourself, or that the jurors didn't understand the law in this case, or that most defense lawyers put their clients last to focus on fame while for prosecutors its about """"the truth"""" isn't constructive on article talk pages.

 Is there a Florida law that could counter the verdict (guilty, not guilty) if it is found that the jurors did not follow the jury instructions?

Jennifer Ford clearly didn't understand that this was the """"guilt phase"""" and not the """"penalty phase""""; furthermore, there were plenty of other degree-options surrounding the murder charge that would not have inflicted the death penalty for which she couldn't live with.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :With all due respect to Nancy Grace, there isn't a chance in H*** that will happen.  The law of Double Jeopardy will prevent her of ever being criminally tried to these offences again.  She could be sued in civil court for wrongful death for money (like OJ was) but her parents seem to be delighted that she was found not guilty so I doubt that would happen.

Po čemu sam ja odbacio sud u Hagu? Po čemu i jedna moja promjena niječe bilo što izrečeno na Haškom sudu? Za Blaškićevu presudu nisam nigdje rekao(ajde pročitaj još jedamput moje riječi!) da nije bilo zločina u Ahmićima, niti sam na nijedan način uopće spomenuo ulogu RH u cijelom sukobu. Rekao sam da se držiš izjava iz Haga bez da ih dokazuješ. Bilo je žalbi u kojima su prijašnje osude odbačene. Npr. Kupreškići. Ali sve od toga je totalno ne bitno za moje promjene! Ima 5 stvari koje uporno briseš(po 555put) 
 1) HDZ je pobjedio u većini općina koje je htio uključiti u HB (imaš rezultat izbora na linku) 
 2) za odcjepljenje i organiziranje nove vlasti je krivio neučinkovist vlasti u Sarajevu. U čemu je problem? Koja nova vlast (pogotovo ako je pučistička) ne krivi staru za sve probleme??? 
 3) HB je proglašena republikom za vrijeme Ženevskih pregovora u kojima se raspravljalo o podjeli BiH na 3 etničke republike. Plan Owen-Stoltenberg? Zar bi svaki pojedini pojam morao imati neki link? (a i linkovi koje sam ti dostavio očito nisu prekorisni jer kada si me tražio rezultate izbora, kasnije si tako i tako izbrisao rečenicu i rekao da rezultatiuopće nisu bitni (zašto si me onda tražio izvore???)) 
 4)priče o početku rata. Rat se rasplamsao nakon što je Travnički kanton dodijeljen Hrvatima i HVO pokušao očistiti A BiH iz njega, tj sukobi oko zajedničkih vojnih snaga (wance-owenow plan) 
 5)oko upotrebe simbola i novca. Na sve te simbole Hrvati su imali pravo kao konstruktivni narod, a što se novca tiče, glavna valuta je tijekom rata bila njemačka marka. Siljenje učenika drugih naroda da se pridržavaju hrvatskog kurikuluma je protuustavno, ali nisam imao vremena da to pravilno formuliram. 
 Nijedna od ovih stvari nije išla na štetu niti bosanske vlasti niti u opravdavanje HBa. Sve stvari opisuju stanje kakvo je bilo na području HBa, od naseljavanja izbjeglica pa na dalje. Jedina stvar koja bi eventualno mogla biti sporna je dio o 'hrvatskom strahu' ali to također još nema ispravnu formulaciju. Svaka promjena je u skladu s NPOV wikipedinom politikom, a ne vidim zašto bi za svaku od ovih stvari morao postojati konkretan link! Minimalno 10 puta sam te pozvao da mi pomogneš oko formulacije svake od navedenih stvari umjesto da ih samo obrišeš! O kakvom doljevanju ulja na vatru govoriš? Ajde daj pročitaj još jedanput NPOV politiku [], da li u njoj piše da smiješ citirati tuđe mišljenje, bez da se slažeš s njime???  Dio sa generalizacijom hrvatskog mišljenja je možda moja greška, ali nikako ne uspjevam naći ispravnu formulaciju za situaciju u kojoj 80-90% biračkog tijela bira pripadnike jedne stranke čije je službeno mišljenje takvo i takvo! Prepucavanje i flip-flop oko neke stranice ne vodi apsolutno ničemu, a pogotovo ne koristi wikipedije. Mislim, koja ti je stvar vraćati sve na staro usprkos svakom dokazu? Na samom početku diskusije si me tražio izvore za rezultate izbora 1990, ja ti ih pošaljem, a ti svejedno izbrišeš rečenicu za koju si tražio potkrijepu??

 ==The Sickness (on Lost)== 

 I mentioned it on my message that you left, and think we should put it on the DISCUSSION page for anyone else to chime in on.

 ==Randall Flagg== 
 Take out the picture of King instead. A picture of the character seems more relevant than his creator, especially seeing that as of now, there are two images of him from the books, two from TV, one of King, and none from the comics.    

 :My image qualm doesn't stop with Palpatine and Jabba. Those are older FAs that were established before the rigorous overhaul of fair use images in articles. Per the actual criteria, you need to have something about the image beyond simple identification (the only exclusion to that is the infobox image). My fear with the article in FAC is that criticism will arise about how influential this character is King's novels, yet how slim the article is on information about him. If you feel it is ready, then go for it. The worst that can happen is that it is not promoted, in which case you will most likely have a lot more eyes telling you what you can do to improve it, thus making it that much better. There is no draw back to not getting promoted other than not getting that little bronze star. D

 Greetings Dark Tower WikiProject member, I would like to invite you to palaver about a possible expansion of the Dark Tower Project to include all Stephen King related items.

 == I am retiring from WP, but please apologize for the false allegation of personal attack, I have evidence refuting it == 

 I have decided to retire from Wikipedia because of administrators' mishandling of the report I put in, in which I took most of the blame for accusations that are false. Drmies, you accused be of personal attack after I stated to Lihaas that I had nothing in common with him because of his stated association with fascism and National Socialism that I refer to as """"Nazism"""" as it is on Wikipedia. Now you and others claim that maybe he is misrepresenting himself - that he meant to say that he is a """"democratic nationalist socialist"""" - - first of all he states on his user page that he is a fascist - and bear in mind that National Socialism as on Wikipedia and in many scholarly works is recognized as a form of fascism. If there is any question as to whether I falsely claimed he was a fascist and Nazi (in the sense of the broader """"National Socialism"""") - look at this userbox on his page: 

  
 The infoboxes repeatedly state """"National Socialist"""" as """"NS"""" on multiple infoboxes. He also has other infoboxes that support far-right ultranationalist political parties- that indicate even further that he is aligned with fascism and National Socialism (as in Nazism), such as: 
  - Jobbik is a far right Hungarian ultranationalist movement with a paramilitary movement called Magyar Gárda (Hungarian Guard) - it is anti-Semitic - it accuses Israel of """"buying up"""" Hungary and its paramilitary group attacks Romani (Gypsy) people. 

  - Ataka - Greek short form for National Union Attack - far-right Bulgarian nationalist movement - acknowledged by all parliamentary parties as a xenophobic movement and a national threat to Bulgaria's ethnic minorities, it known for hate speech, the Ataka's leader's son sent an anti-Romani email to members of the European Parliament - sniding that Hungary is """"full"""" of Romani. 
  L.A.O.S. short form for Popular Orthodox Rally - a far-right Greek nationalist movement - it opposes any immigration from outside the European Union 
 
 True, he has contradictory userboxes - it may mean he is politically confused or has mixed opinions. Bottom line, from the statements of his userboxes, he is not merely a nationalistic socialist, his userboxes make clear that he is a fascist National Socialist and that he supports multiple far-right ultranationalist political parties - two of which have promoted xenophobia towards ethnic minorities - Jobbik towards Jews and Romani, and Ataka towards Romani. When Lihaas started confronting me, I stated on Lihaas' userpage that I fundamentally opposed his views and do not want to associate with him or talk with him because of those views - that is my choice and my right not to be forced to accept unwanted postings on my talk page. I don't care whether he wants to keep them or not, I think he has the right of personal liberty to post his political views - but he should not expect everyone to respect his stated support of fascism, National Socialism, and far-right ultranationalist movements - as I said, I do not want to talk with a person who adheres to such views.  

 I am preparing my final retirement from Wikipedia so please respond here, but I want an apology for administrators' mishandling of this, I was honest and stating what he himself posted on his user page when I said he was a fascist and a Nazi, his userpage says that he """"is a Fascist"""" and that he """"is a National Socialist"""" and his support of Jobbik and other far-right ultranationalist parties - just put those together in your mind and take note where the term National Socialism redirects to on Wikipedia: Nazism - and I referred to Nazism in its general form of an ideology and its continuation in a general form as neo-Nazism. Lihaas may claim that he does not support German Nazism, but when I first noticed these tendencies on his talk page - I noticed the anti-Romani, anti-Semitic Jobbik movement first of all, then looked on and saw the other two infoboxes I mentioned - all the same - I do not want to talk with someone who supports far-right ultranationalist movements that promote xenophobia - that is my choice not to talk to the person and my right not to have the person talk to me after I have told them not to.

 == Revision of lede == 

 I've put together a draft revision of the article's lede. 

 ===Current revision=== 

 Here's the current revision of the lede (2011-12-24, 14:30) for reference: 

  
 :Global warming refers to the rising average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and its projected continuation. In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.[2] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more than 90% certain most of it is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels.[3][4][5][6] These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized countries.[7][A] 

 :Climate model projections are summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicate that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 1.1 to 2.9 °C (2 to 5.2 °F) for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.4 to 6.4 °C (4.3 to 11.5 °F) for their highest.[8] The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.[9][10] 

 :An increase in global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, and a probable expansion of subtropical deserts.[11] Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic and would be associated with continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely effects of the warming include more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events, species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes, and changes in agricultural yields. Warming and related changes will vary from region to region around the globe, with projections being more robust in some areas than others.[12] In a 4 °C world, the limits for human adaptation are likely to be exceeded in many parts of the world, while the limits for adaptation for natural systems would largely be exceeded throughout the world. Hence, the ecosystem services upon which human livelihoods depend would not be preserved.[13] 

 :Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),[14] whose ultimate objective is to prevent """"dangerous"""" anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) climate change.[15] Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions[16]:10[17][18][19]:9 and to assist in adaptation to global warming.[16]:13[19]:10[20][21] Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required,[22] and that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial level.[22][B] Analyses by the United Nations Environment Programme (published in 2011)[23] and International Energy Agency (2011)[24] suggest that current efforts to reduce emissions may be inadequately stringent to meet the UNFCCC's 2 °C target. 

  
 I have some problems with this revision. In my opinion, parts of it are too long, too technical/jargony, confusing, or imprecise/vague. 

 ===Suggested revision=== 

 Cited sources are given later on in the references section. If other editors agree with parts of my suggested revision, I'll change the references to make them consistent with the rest of the article:

In the last 100 years, Earth's average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F) with about two thirds of the increase occurring over just the last three decades.[2] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and is evident from observations of increases in global air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level (IPCC, 2007d, SYR 6.1 Observed changes in climate and their effects, and their causes). 

 :Since the start of the industrial revolution in 1750, human activities have lead to an increase in the concentration of heat-trapping """"greenhouse"""" gases in the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, but also through changes in land use, such as deforestation (Denman, et al, 2007, FAQ 7.1 ﻿﻿Are the Increases in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases During the Industrial Era Caused by Human Activities?﻿). Scientists are more than 90% certain that most of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century was caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (IPCC, 2007d, SPM 2.

 :::Well, Permyakia and Perm Oblast have established economic ties and a lot of common infrastructure—that's one of the main reasons.  Also, Permyakia is heavily dotational, relying on the federal transfers to form a significant portion of its budget.  Problem is, federal government is not always good with transferring funds timely, which, as you imagine, creates all sorts of issues.  Perm Oblast, on the other hand, is a donor, and once both budgets are merged, it will ease the pain somewhat (but note that during 2006 there will still be two separate budgets, so there will be a transitional period).  Another thing—Permyakia will still have a special status within new Perm Krai.  The main scoop is that Permyakia will no longer need to rely on federal government's transfers (but will, of course, become dependent of Perm Krai's budget), and Perm Oblast will gain access to Permyakia's resources.  The merger also lowers administrative costs—instead of two local governments there will only be one.  Considering that Russians and Komi-Permyaks co-existed peacefully for quite some time, there is something in this merger for both parties.

"01231ff69280665d","Schmidt was just the best-funded advisor on privatisation methods in Estonia.  Treuhand Ost-Beratung financed e.g. Finnish-numbered fax machines and other support.  USAID and the EU PHARE project provided counterbalancing advice which took into account the voucher system that had been instituted in Estonia, which was alien to Schmidt's German experience.  Indeed, in opposing the first public offerings for shares, in the manner of Margaret Thatcher's government in Britain, Schmidt commented that such methods equated to the reintroduction of communism.  When majority stakes were sold in former state enterprises according to the classic German method, especially to entities associated with the state enterprises' managers, questions were asked as to whether the majority shareholders were unduly profiting by not treating their part-subsidiaries at arm's length. Schmidt should not be credited with the mixed method of privatisation instituted in Estonia."

 New page created, feel free to add or edit.   
 :wHILST I would dearly love to see this page blossom, I cannot seem to be able to justify it. I feel that the subject should have no more mention than a parqagraph in an article on the 2012 Games as a whole. Having said that I amhoping that I spark a discussion that will enable the coorect path to be chosen. P.S. my ex-wife is going to be one of the torch-bearers!!   
 ::Actually I kinda agree. Let's leave here for a few days and then see what LOCOG use the plane for next! If it disappears back into the BA schedules perhaps I should move the whole page to WikiNews??   
 :::On further reflection I have moved most of the non-aviation material to a new section of 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.

  wrote concern = Not notable outside of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay, failing WP:GNG and WP:ONEEVENT.  Any useful information can be merged there (which most of it is already).  No real need for a redirect as it is an unlikely search term. 
 :However she/he did not put any discussion on this page to discuss this deletion first.   reveals s/he has a tendency to delete articles without a full discussion on appropriate pages and wikiprojects eg Wikipedia:AVIA. Her/his reasons for deletion may be valid but please let's have an informed discussion first.   
 ::Wikipedia has several modern aircraft used for specific purposes, eg VC-137C SAM 26000 in the USA. These specially painted Airbus aircraft will have several purposes during the Summer Olympics, not just the arrival of the Olympic Torch. Can we wait a bit before Speedy Deletion? Perhaps widen scope of article to include all 9 Airbus aircraft with livery designed by Pascal Anson.   
 :::Lidos, as I (just) mentioned on your talk page, the WP:PROD process does not require discussion (and is completely different from the Speed Deletion process.  There was nothing wrong my actions, nor was any offensive intended towards you nor an attempt to circumvent any discussion.  lease review what PROD means before making further allegations.  If you think an article deserves a deletion discussion (aka an WP:AFD process), whether or not you believe the article should (or would/will) be deleted it is perfectly acceptable to remove the PROD tag without comment (though preferably a reason should be given.). Finally, I do not agree that the article (even if expanded in scope) will ever meet WP:GNG and intend to bring the article to WP:AFD."

 It seems  suddenly decided to delete all Seventh Framework Programme projects articles, using the same copy-paste arguments: Ephemeral project. No independent sources, no indication of notability. Does not meet WP:GNG. 

 The CyberEmotions project is one of the major projects of the 7th Framework Programme in terms of financial funding, as well as in terms of duration, number of research teams involved, and multidisciplinarity of these teams. If this article is deleted, so should be for instance FINNOV, DARIAH, or EGAIS. Five Wikipedia articles about emotions and the Internet link to CyberEmotions. The reason for this is the importance of studying collective phenomena on the internet to prevent negative events, with repercussion both inside and outside of the online world. This is one of the purpose of CyberEmotions. 

 Furthermore, the notability of the project is already partially demonstrated in the Research section. A series of references to high quality peer-reviewed journals are made (e.g., Physica), in a brief summary of some of the findings of the project so far. 

 This Wikipedia article will be improved, and its relevance and notability for understanding collective phenomena on the Internet will be clearly demonstrated."

 == Question == 

 Is it okay to use letter written from the trenches as a source when writing a wikipedia article.  For example I assume that you could use published letters to verify an oppinion of soldiers during a war, but could you use it as a verifiable source for facts?  Like when published civil war letters state that they are employeeing snipers at a certain battle, would said letter be enough to site it as a fact, or do you need further proof.  Also If the letters ARE NOT published can you use them to show oppinions of soldiers during war.  For example if I have possesion of several letters from the civil war stating that soldiers from the war stated that they dont believe the """"fredom of a few nigers"""" is worth the war, can I thereby state that not all soldiers of the north even agreed with the abolishment of slavery.

 == Norepi makes you think better == 

 I disagreed rather directly to your response to a question at the science reference desk, and decided to send you my reply directly to facilitate dialogue: 

 ::In response to your question specifically, no, being stressed does not make you think better. The Blood brain barrier prevents large molecules in the blood stream from entering the nervous system, protecting it from most infections. Although norepinephrine can be found in the brain and in the body in general, the norepinephrine produced by the adrenal glands doesn't reach the brain. Norepinephrine in the brain is produced by neurons and stays in the brain.  

 ::Besides, think pracitcally: when you're stressed, don't you find that you are more grumpy, unstable and more prone to making bad decisions? Do you personally think that you or those around you """"think better"""" when you're stressed? Faster maybe, but better? 

 ::Moreover, although drugs that boost norepinephrine availability have been useed to treat ADHD, the general idea that having alot of neurotransmitter in general makes you think better is a little confused. Having alot of a neurotransmitter may sound good but it's usually not and often can result in psychiatric disorders of chemical imbalance. Dopamine is commonly used as an example: dopamine deficiency results in Alzheimers, and dopamine excess can cause Schizophrenia.   """

 Tell Tyrone to check his messages. A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation has made an attempt to contact Stephen Colbert through his staff. In the meantime, I'm still gathering more information about the specific linking issue.   (Lee)  
 :That's an edit summary in an admin's block log, not a message sent to anyone in any official capacity  contrary to popular opinion, some Wikipedians do have a sense of humor. The message that was sent to him would represent an attempt to ascertain identity following an established procedure. If Colbert wants to promote his site here, all he needs to do is make a trivial effort to establish his identity to the Foundation, which is already seeking to contact him as we speak. Not that I have anything to do with this, but I thought I might alert you to a simple way around this.   (Lee)  

 :Sheeh. I apologize for not being more clear. I didn't exactly expect you to go searching through miscellaneous site logs when I mentioned that someone from the Foundation was attempting to contact Colbert. The Wikimedia Fountation is, just to clear, the non-profit organization that handles Wikipedia's business and legal affairs. They're seeking to contact him, actually, over events related to the previous night's """"Wikiality"""" discussion on the Report  this is something I heard through the grapevine and not anything I know much about  but I thought perhaps that if this site is indeed a scrappy little underdog of a marketing campaign for book whick Colbert considers his baby, he or a representative might want to bother to have a fifteen minute discussion which would allow tek-related information to happily coexist with Wikipedia's policies. He doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to, but since the folks at the tekjansen site seem to be somewhat preoccupied with the status of a single link here  and have us listed as their top referrer, despite the link being down half the time  I thought the option might be of interest. No, huh?   (Lee)  

 :Re-read the above. I did not say they had to falsify the list in order for Wikipedia to be the top referrer. I suggested a brief phone conversation might be worth the trouble if we're generating the bulk of their traffic and they're looking to promote. Take a deep breath. 
 :I also did not say Colbert has to verify his identity in any way. However, since the site seems to fail several points of our linking policy, yes, the site is likely to be removed without additional information being provided. I'm sorry, but the """"it's relevant anyway"""" angle is fairly weak; the only reason this material would be an especially relevant resource on Colert would be if it was actually Colbert's writing. It does not have information on anything relevant to Stephen's biography. Generally speaking, we don't count fan forums as an invaluable, unique resource  see WP:EL.  That leaves the book, which, while possibly being Colbert's, is irrelevant if it's not. I could write a novel about Charlene and post in on my website, and that would also not be relevant. Or a novel about Stephen Colbert for that matter. In any case, I'm sorry that for some reason I seem to have pissed you off.

 You wrote: 
 :that Judaic sources on Hebrew not claim authoritarian ownership of that language. I would love for you to present the sources you claim contradict the Yeshua transliteration. I for one am curious as to the nature of the so-called controversy you describe 
 *I am not sure what you mean about """"Judaic sources"""" claiming """"authoritarian ownership of Hebrew.  Which sources?  Did you mean Alkalai and Chomski?  I think they are authorities because of their research as linguists, not because they are Jewish (and I can only assume they are from their names, but I have no idea whatsoever how they self-identify or what their beliefs are).  The textbook on Biblical Hebrew I used in college was definitely written by a Gentile, I do not have it on hand; the Hebrew-English Concordance we used, Brown-Drivers-Briggs, was not by Jews.  So when you refer to """"Judaic sources"""" I really do not know what you are talking about and you have to spell it out for me. 
 * You want my sources contradicting your transliteration?  Please read my first comment on the talk page again.  Please read the second one.  Please read Andrew Card's.  I never claimed to have any sources contradicting your transliteration, indeed, I said - and I wrote this yesterday, it was in my first comment - I said your reconstruction was plausible.  our reason for reverting it is not because we have sources contradicting it.  It is because we know of no historical sources that provide Jesus' name in Hebrew or Aramaic (which by the way I never said were unrelated.  Never.)  Andre, Leadwind, and I are reverting your edit because we are supporting a consensus reached by many editors, who reached that conclusion because no historian has ever provided a historical source for Jesus' name in Hebrew or in Aramaic.  Will Durant speculated what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name would have been but it is a speculation.  There is no mainstream view, because there are no historical sources.  I said this several times: N-O S-O-U-R-C-E-S.  Why do you ask me for my source when I gave as my reason the fact that there are n...o  s...o..u..r..c..e..s?  
 * You want to know the controversy I describe.  The Yeshu stories in the Talmud are considered by some modern scholars to be about Jesus (and by the way, those modern scholars do not see them as pejorative of Jesus but as reflecting through stories Jews' ambivalent feelings about Jesus and Christianity), but many modern scholars as well as medieval scholars argue that they are not about Jesus (in which case they cannot possibly be pejorative about Jesus and Christianity).  One reason why there is this controversy (is it Jesus?  is it not?) is because it is unclear what """"ha notzri"""" means - many argue that it is a reference to a religious community described by Jerimiah (long before Jesus was born, and not """"Nazarene"""").  And of course the other reason is that it is not at all clear that Yeshu or Yeshua was Jesus' name in Aramaic.  All of this controversy does not mean that Yeshu or Yeshua was not Jesus' name in Aramaic.  It does mean that we do not know.  My point was that the one case where we definitely have an Aramaic name, the earliest text with an Aramaic name one might think was Jesus's Aramaic name, there is lots of controversy as to whether this name has any connection to Jesus, and whether the name is proper Aramaic, and what the name means or who it refers to.  If there is all this controversy over the earliest texts we have with an Aramaic name, it seems to me that the most one could do today is say that Jesus' Aramaic name may have been Yeshu or Yeshua.  We just have no reliable historical documents relating to this question. 

 Without any reliable sources, any claim as to what Jesus' Hebrew or Aramaic name was would be original research, and that is forbidden by Wikipedia policy. 

 Get it?  I am not saying my sources about Jesus' are better than your and I never said my sources were better than yours (I simply pointed out what was false in some claims you made about Hebrew and Aramaic.  And that has nothing to do with someone being Jewish and someone being Christian, it was you who suggested and seem to continue to suggest that.  You are not wrong """"because"""" you are Christian.  You are just wrong.  And Christian who is also a scholar of Biblical Hebrew and of Aramaic and of Ancient Near Eastern history would also tell you you were wrong about your claims about Hebrew and Aramaic).  I am saying that THERE ARE NO HISTORICAL SOURCES AS TO JESUS"""" HEBREW OR ARAMAIC NAME so any Wikipedian making a reconstruction IS VIOLATING NOR. 

 Why do I have to repeat this?  Reread my first comment to you explaining my revert.  I continue to stand my it.  Every sentence of my first comment is true.    |   17:14, 21 January 200"

 1946 

 Ground-breaking Ceremony  
 at Sunnydale Academy  

 Promptly at 2 o'clock on the afternoon  
 of February 18 a goodly number of  
 workers, lay members, business associates  
 and friends from the surrounding com-  
 munities met on the future nine-acre  
 campus for a ground-breaking ceremony  
 marking the beginning of the girls' dorm-  
 itory, the first building to be erected at  
 our academy.  

 The program was presented from a  
 temporary platform erected on the future  
 site of the new building. Superinten-  
 dent H. C. Hartman served as master of  
 ceremonies, introducing the program  
 and speakers.  

 Elder Leon Robbins from St. Louis  
 offered the opening prayer. Elder G. E.  
 Hutches, president of the board of di-  
 rectors, sketched the """"Historic Back-  
 ground,"""" relating the activities of the  
 academy commission from the day it  
 was organized until the day in October,  
 1945, when the end of the long search  
 for an academy site was reached.  

 A hearty welcome was extended to the  
 academy from Centralia by Mr. Julius Ed-  
 wards from the First National Bank and  
 from the community by Mr. John  
 Shindler.  

 Elder G. R. Fattic, Central Union ed-  
 ucational secretary, outlined the purposes  
 and objectives of our three hundred ed-  
 ucational institutions the world over,  
 assuring the hearers that we had come  

 to be a permanent institution in this  
 community and the state of Missouri.  

 Elder E. E. Cossentine, president of  
 Union College, welcomed Sunnydale  
 \cademv into the sisterhood of acade-  
 mies comprising Union's territory. He  
 stated that Union College would be  
 happy to accept the first graduates as  
 well as future graduates in view of the  
 fact that Sunnydale will be staffed quite  
 largely by fully accredited teachers from  
 Union College.  

 Mr. Hartman pointed out the loca-  
 tions of the proposed building sites for  
 the girls' dormitory, boys' domitory, ad-  
 ministration building, teachers' cottages,  
 superintendent's home, and other fu-  
 ture structures to be erected on the  
 spacious nine-acre plot. He then intro-  
 duced Mr. Robert Deering, Columbia  
 arcritect who drew the plans for the  
 girls' domitory. Mr. Deering briefly out-  
 lined the outstanding features of the  
 building which will house 80 girls and  
 expressed his belief in its beauty, prac-  
 tibility, and adequacy.  

 Staff Sergeant Willard L. Bresee was  
 next introduced as building supervisor  
 and he made a brief response. Because  
 of Sgt. Bresee's experience in supervising  
 the erection of a number of other large  
 buildings, such as the auditorium and  
 Don Lo\e industrial building located  
 on the Union College campus, we can  
 be assured of well constructed edifices.  

 In an earnest dedicatory prayer Elder  
 C. M. Babcock from Columbia pre-  
 sented the plot of ground to the throne  
 of grace, asking that the purposes for  
 which it had been set aside be carried  
 out.  

 Then with Mr. Hartman at the con-  
 trols of a caterpillar tractor and Elder  
 Hutches guiding the plow, Mr. HerscJiel  
 Turner driv ing -a team of typical Missouri  
 mules and Elder Babcock holding an-  
 other plow, deep furrows were made in  
 preparation for laving the foundation  
 of the new building.  

 In spite of cloudv, wet weather every-  
 one seemed to recognize the advantages  
 of a location where pure air, sunshine, and  
 spacious, roomy lawns provide an ideal  
 setting for student home life.  

 A serious, interested atmosphere pre-  
 \aded the group as this milestone was  
 reached, and we rejoice that our acad-  
 emy is started; for its primary purpose  

 is to help save Missouri youth and aid  
 in preparing them for the kingdom of  
 God.

 ==Features== 
 As well as traditional timekeeping, Apple Watch will allow wearers to make contactless payments with Apple Pay, a mobile payment service introduced at the same event as the Watch. The Apple Watch is capable of receiving phone calls as well as iMessage and SMS Texts. It can track fitness, run third-party apps built using WatchKit, Apple's new API for Apple Watch software development, control the Apple TV, as well as act as a walkie-talkie and a viewfinder and remote shutter-release for an iPhone camera. 

 ===Design=== 
 Apple Watch will be available in a number of customisable design configurations, across three distinct 'collections', in two sizes (38 mm and 42 mm), making 34 individual models. Considering the number of physical models, and the wide variety of digital watch faces available on each model, the potential to personalise Apple Watch is considerable. Apple's head of design Jony Ive stated in an interview after Apple Watch was announced that the total possible number of unique designs is 'in the millions', although it is as yet unclear whether this is an exaggeration. 

 Apple Watch also features a new, pressure-sensitive touchscreen that can distinguish between a tap and a press, and features a dial called a digital crown, which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, allowing the user to interact with content on the display without obscuring it with their fingers. It also features a 'Taptic Engine'; a linear actuator which provides haptic feedback to users when they interact with the watch, or when they receive notifications, as well as allowing them to share physical 'taps' with other Apple Watch users. 

 The watch is charged by means of inductive charging, using a cable similar to the MagSafe cable for Apple's MacBook family of laptops. Reports also suggest that the retail box for the 'Edition' series of the Apple Watch will act as a combined charging and display stand."

 Thank you, Soulscanner. One thing is sure now, this article is total crap. You still live in the 1970's or what ? The Quebec nation is a fact, if you don't want to write it in the lead, you are a liar. You are an ignorant on that issue and your references are not reliable. You take POV from columnists of La Presse or from The Globe and Mail, and you know those are not reliable sources. Your methods are the same used by Goebbels in the 2nd World War. I have no respect for you and I want you to know that all what you write on Quebec is seriously biased and that you are far from reality.

"0192e3c7e75e272e","Ring mail, mail, plate mail. 

 Hello 
 There is indeed several type of mail and again in different countries ended up calling them a different way. 

 All the historical mail I have seen is 1 in 4 or 1 in 6, oriental style as in Japanese and Moghul/ Mongolian, this done with flat or round rings. 

 Now if I say 1 in 4 to you how do you know if I am refencing the “European” 1 in 4 or kagomegata-gusari  futae-gusari, kame-ko-gusari (or the Indian equivalent) 

 Oriental mail organises the ring differently. The rings are flat on the fabric and they are linked but much smaller oval rings. There are several patterns. Regardless it is very different in construction from “European” mail. 
 My understanding, and I can be wrong, is that the Victorian used the tern ring mail to describe the European mail in opposition to the oriental way, which was called chain mail. 
 To be fair, it has good as anything yes the even the flat rings when mounted looks like a succession of rings and the oriental mounting look like a chain.  

 If you take some Moguls, Mongol and Islamic armour, some of them have the same oriental disposition and link small plate of metal. Those plates are separated by and attached to strip of mail.

"0196edbfdbd1741c","""The whole concept of blocking and banning is an anachronistic tribal practice that not only predates the advent of the Rule of Law, it's the very subject of the first three laws ever carved onto stone tablets, some 3750 years ago... 

  
 Hammurabi of Mesopotamia 

 These are the first three laws, in their entirety, of the Code of Hammurabi, translated into English: 

 :1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death. 

 :2. If any one bring an accusation against a man, and the accused go to the river and leap into the river, if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house. But if the river prove that the accused is not guilty, and he escape unhurt, then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death, while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser.  

 :3. If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death.  

 The second law seems bizarre by modern standards. It appears to be the source of the dismissive phrase, """"Go jump in the lake.""""  (Compare to the Yiddish expression, Nem zich a vaneh! """"Go take a bath!  Go jump in the lake!"""") 

 There are 282 such laws in the Code of Hammurabi, each no more than a sentence or two.  The 282 laws are bracketed by a pukeworthy Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself, and a narcissistic Epilogue in which he affirms his authority and sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws. 

 Note that Wikipedia is not even as evolved as Hammurabi, since Wikipedia does not even do the level of due process required of Hammurabi's first law. 

 Given that Wikipedia has adopted an anachronistic pre-Hammurabic tribalistic ochlocracy that does not even rise to the level of the Code of Hammurabi, is it any wonder that Wikipedia is the venue of recurring classic liminal social drama that reprises the oldest stories in the annals of human history?   

 Hammurabi's notion was to advise everyone to go jump in the lake when they are tainted with an unproven allegation. 

 I reckon the secular cultural practice of absolution through ablution inspired the Early Morning Baptisers of Qumran to co-opt Hammurabi's Remedy into the Mikvah Ritual Bath. Baptismal sin cleansing survives to this day in most Christian denominations. 

 Of course there was that interlude in the desert where there were no bodies of holy water, so Aaron devised an alternate ritual involving a delightful goat named Caprice. I am rather fond of Caprice, since her story inspired portions of the Passion of Christ. 

 I find it ironic that a site that purports to offer the sum of all human knowledge is still struggling to learn the oldest lessons in the annals of human history. 

 So I suggest people wash their hands of Jimbo's anachronistic cult of pre-Hammurabic tribalism, cleanse themselves of the grit by jumping in the lake, and evolving to a more modern and enlightened governance model along the lines suggested by such innovative pioneers as Moses, Socrates, Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tsu, Maimonides, Thomas Becket, Stephen Langton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, ML King, Thich Nhat Hanh, John Rawls, Father John Dear, Barak Obama, Kermit the Frog, and Barsoom Tork Associates.

I understand the post mortem is continuing, and I hope that the revised IEP plan for next semester will be on a scale that won't cause anything like the current impact, but because of the scale of the additional work caused I think a great many people will be very upset if there is not a very clear dialogue with the community about your plans before you commit to the IEP's next incarnation.  I've argued that the community should be more involved with the discussions about the future of the USEP, as you know; but as I've said in those discussions I think the USEP is in pretty good shape and if you decide to go in a different direction to the one I've suggested I think it will be OK.

 == Heritage Listed Buildings == 

 I was looking up information on heritage listed buildings in Albury, with regards to state listings vs local council only listings. 

 The main two references I could found were Wikipedia, and an article in The Border Mail which is here:  
 http://www.bordermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/alburys-heritage-buildings-at-risk/1834299.aspx 

 This article unfortunately doesn't provide a full listing, but it DOES conflict with the list provided on Wikipedia, specifically stating that specific buildings (ie the Post Office) are NOT state heritage listed, when Wikipedia states that it is. Another building, the Waterstreets Hotel, I know for a fact is defiantely state heritage listed as it correctly states in the Border Mail article, but it is NOT listed on the Wikipedia list. Also noticed that the list on here seems to have two double ups as well, further calling it's reliablity into doubt. 

 Does anyone know where a full, referenced list of state heritage listed buildings in Albury? It would be good to get this right, and then perhaps also make a list of """"other significant historical buildings in Albury"""" or something like that.  """

So if you perform a Lorentz transformation of points A and B, from system S (where the ships are moving with v after acceleration) to S' (where they are at rest after acceleration), you are calculating the endpoints of resting objects in S', thus you have the rest length of the objects and the distance between the endpoints. And what do the Lorentz-Trafos tell us? Well they unambiguously show that the distance between A and B (again, those are the coordinates of the endpoints of in S' resting objects) has increased as compared to the coordinate length between A and B in S. Of course, this is in perfect agreement with relativity of simultaneity, which shows that the spaceships started at different times in S', thus they had different accelerations... 
 ::::Summarizing: 1) You have two endpoints A and B with different accelerations in S', therefore they are moving away from each other in S', and after the acceleration the distance of the now resting objects has increased, and the string has been stretched. 2) Of course, one can also choose frame S in which the accelerations """"appeared"""" to be the same due to relativity of simultaneity, and therefore the increased distance in S' """"apparently"""" stays the same in S. (Actually, one should abandon the word """"appear"""" in relativity, it serves no purpose and only distracts one from correctly applying the Lorentztransformation.)  
 ::::Now, Dewan, Beran, and Bell unfortunately started with 2) and only afterwards at 1), so they had to focus their attention mostly on S and on length contraction, which caused much confusion by some readers. But the paradox is much easier to understand if one (like Petkov and Franklin) starts with 1) and then look at 2).

Croats from northern Croatia are much more genetically close to neighboring Hungarians or Austrians than they are to remote Russians. The same is valid for any other imaginary collective that we call nation-state or civilizational milieu. Ivan Štambuk (talk)  

 For your information Slaven, not Slav is the original word. And the word """"Slaven"""" means in a number of germanic languages (consult german or english dictionaries for more info) a """"dirty boy"""". Think of a prepubescent or a teenager's face and clothes after a game of football and you may get the picture. Only in your twisted and ignorant head the word """"Slav"""" means something. ANd of all things you claim that it means """"those who speak like us""""... 

 In which language? Do tell.  

 Ignorant.  

 How about tis other """"pearl"""" from local """"authority"""" on everything: 

 """"Croats from northern Croatia are much more genetically close to neighboring Hungarians or Austrians than they are to remote Russians. The same is valid for any other imaginary collective that we call nation-state or civilizational milieu."""" 

 A number of genetical studies have been conducted since the war in Jugoslavia and every single one has confirmed that 51% of Croats, especially those near Austria and Hungary are genetically Slavens (Slavs, if you prefer) and as such are identical to Russians, not to Austrians or Hungarians. Many of these studies have been conducted by Croatians too, so above """"pearl"""" is only indicative of the size of Stambuk's ignorance, already verified too many times to mention here. 

 Another genius, among many, tty29a quotes here and then misses the point completely: 

 """"    Another cold fact is that Ča- Kaj- and I-kavski are not even dialects. Rather, they are deflections of adjectives (in Ikavski, ijekavski, ekavski) and/or pronouns (in sto-sta- kaj- ca- kavski). Fundamental grammatical rules are identical and do not change beyond what could only be described as dialectal differences between Ča- Kaj Sto- Sta- I- kavski. 
     Let me see if I got this right. They're not dialects but they have dialectal differences? You seem to be in disagreement with your self. Deflections of adjectives and pronouns? Really? Also, if the grammatical systems are identical, why do they have different case and tense systems? I honestly hope you're just a troll. tty29a:talk """" 

 Have a look at this from the quote by tty29a: """"Fundamental grammatical rules are identical and do NOT change beyond what could only be described as dialectal differences between Ča- Kaj Sto- Sta- I- kavski."""" 

 And tty29a misses the NOT completely to come up with this nonsense: """"They're not dialects but they have dialectal differences? You seem to be in disagreement with your self."""" 

 The only one in disagreement with himself is tty29a. The other person who wrote the quoted text made it CLEAR that they are NOT dialects. 

 And the story goes on and on, forever and ever. Few and far inbetween with some understanding and knowledge, but for the most part just a bunch of ignorants debating things which they do not have the capacity, intellectual one, to grasp and process before they grab the microphone and start making fools of themselves. 

 As a linguist with 27 years of experience, I am apalled with the level of ignorance that reigns here. You people have no idea what you are talking about and yet you have take to yourselves to be the arbitrators who say what goes and what doesn't.  

 You are products of your consumeristic and instant gratification society. Online anarchists who believe in some higher purpose that the rest of us must absorb and abide by your decisions in order to make it happen. Linguistic cannibals. 

 And, indeed, that is all you poor wretches are. Linguistic cannibals."""

 :: Well, may I ask both of you to refrain from personal attacks here. 
 :: In general, there is of course no rule that there must be exactly one writer or painter etc. But having a choice, I think one should try to get as large diversity as possible. It is true, that the diversity is not only in terms of occupation but also gender, time etc. I think there is currently a good coverage of different times starting with James Mayer de Rothschild, i.e. from the beginning of the 19th century. One may think of including a rabbi from an earlier age. There is a dedicated section on Rashi with a woodcut showing him, therefore I thought it is not necessary to include the same picture once again in the collage. I don't have another candidate. 
 :: My comments to the proposed persons: 
 ::* I agree with  that Michel de Montaigne and Irène Némirovsky are bad candidates for the reasons given above. The relation to Holocaust is not really established by including Némirovsky. She was murdered in the Holocaust, but there is no """"story"""" behind it on which the reader would focus. 
 ::* As for Simone Weil, she can be considered as an alternative to Mirra Alfassa, if there are good arguments why she is a better candidate. One may have one person who converted to another faith, as an explicit example. 
 ::* As for Chagall vs. Pissarro, whatever the motivation of some editor may or may not be, we should not make our choice to show this editor that he/she is right or wrong. I vote for Pissarro, for two reasons: 1) to increase the Sephardi faction, and 2) because Chagall is included in at least 4 other collages (Russian Jews, Belarussian Jews, Ashkenazy Jews and Jews). Having the same person in all collages makes the reader think that there was only one Jewish artist worth mentioning.  
 ::* As for Marcel Proust, I cannot yet judge. In my opinion, if someone comes from a mixed family, the person can be considered if a kind of Jewish identity can be seen in the biography. E.g. in the case of Pissarro, it is written about his father that """"Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas' Protestant church."""" This tells me that the father was a member of the Jewish community (while the mother was probably protestant), and this should have been reflected in the family life. Is there any sign of Jewish identity in the case of Proust? And if yes, whom can Proust replace in the collage?   """

 :As for the examples provided the Soviet term, the """"Great Patriotic War"""" was that not constructed as a propaganda name to help construct a fighting sprit among the people?

In times past, inferential structure was taught as part of the syllabus in dialectic and logic, but it seems that you did not attend to it, and have not developed a sensitivity to it through experience in study of physics. Important distinctions that are made in logic and dialectic are between definitions, theoretical principles, axioms or postulates, empirical observations and demonstrations, empirical generalizations, inferences, deductions, inductions, abductions, hypotheses, assertions, assumptions, conclusions, contradictions, inconsistencies, incoherences, and theorems. These all have their places in the presentation of physics, but you seem more or less unable to see how they fit together to provide overall inferential structure, apparently because you have not attended to it or do not value it. Your rhetorical questions just above seem to support this reading of the appearances. As I have mentioned before, you may not be entirely to blame for your difficulty here: some writers, including Kittel & Kroemer, and Reif, regrettably think they are very clever in trying to teach thermodynamics as a consequence of or as part of statistical mechanics. Thus Kittle & Kroemer actually entitle their text Thermal Physics; the result is that students become muddled about the overall inferential structure of the subjects, and get into the difficulties such as those that beset you.

 Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) 

 Large quantities of water are used during the crude oil extraction process. Up to about 1.5 cubic meters of water are characteristically used to process one tonne of FFB. From this quantity, about 50% of the water results in the POME, the other 50% being lost as steam, mainly through sterilizer exhaust, piping leakages, as well as wash waters (Oil Palm & The Environment A Malaysian Perspective, 1999). 

 POME comprises a combination of the wastewaters which are principally generated and discharged from the following major processing operations as seen early in Fig. 2.1. 
 #Sterilization of FFB - sterilizer condensate is about 36% of total POME; 
 #Clarification of the extracted CPO - clarification wastewater is about 60% of total POME; and 
 #Hydrocyclone separation of cracked mixture of kernel and shell-hydrocyclone wastewater is about 4% of total POME. 

 There are other minor sources of relatively clean wastewater that may be included in the combined mill effluent POME which is sent to the wastewater stream. These include turbine cooling water and steam condensates, boiler blow-downs, overflows from the vacuum dryers and some floor washings. The volume of the combined POME discharged depends to a large extent on the milling operations."

And you will grow old and die in penniless misery because you act like an idiot, and your children will curse you for being so stupid as to not buy gold, silver and oil when it was obviously the correct thing to do, and they will drive you from their doors when you beg for crusts of bread.

"01f555f077058a4a","Of course it is more complex than that. I would suggest everyone’s identity in Ireland (and elsewhere) is a lot more complex than that. However, we agree that he was Irish (the country of his and his families birth). You strive to identify his nuanced form of Irish identity. I do not think this is helpful, as this is contentious and can not be simply asserted in the opening paragraph. 

 So, if we have to discuss his form of Irish identity (I think dealt with quite sufficiently in the subsequent section, his protestant background etc) we need to understand that 
 1. Anglo-Irishness generally refers to the wave of “new-english” colonisation which occurred after the 16th century. Clearly Wellington’s ancestry pre-dates this time frame (Online: The Anglo-Irish, Fidelma Maguire, University College Cork). Indeed, the Norman invasion brought his family to Ireland along with other families such as Burke, Fitgerald, Darcy, Joyce, Barry, Clare etc., families which cannot but be declared simply Irish. 
 2. Since the 19th century, the term Anglo-Irish has been used in a prejudicial manner to marginalize a certain section of the Irish population (Online: The Anglo-Irish, Fidelma Maguire, University College Cork). The term is consequently contentious.  
 3. Finally, even for those historical figures whose ancestry does fall into the correct time frame according to Maguire, for example Charles Stuart Parnell, Isaac Butt, John Millington Synge, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, WB Yeats, Samuel Beckett (or was he of Huguenot!), they are clearly identified as Irish in the literature and, rather importantly in this case, Wikipedia articles. 
 I therefore see no reason why the same standards and logic should apply and why Wellington should not be included in such outstanding company. Can you?"

 :As for the Thames, where there's a connection to the Transit in terms of development (even development of the marketplace), then I'd certainly agree it should get a mention in the text, but if it was never called Transit, and didn't share a floorpan, it probably shouldn't be in anything so big as a sub-section. Really, in that circumstance, it should have its own article, and be linked to appropriately. Have a look at the treatment of the LDV Pilot to see how the old Morris pre-Sherpa vans are mentioned. 
 :And just to be clear, I'm not disagreeing with you over what Ford themselves count as part of the Transit line. It's just that that's not the point with regard to inclusion of the German van. The point is, the article is where people come if they're interested in Transits. Only the reader knows which Transit they mean. We include the verifiable """"Transit"""" information and let that speak for itself. I don't think the article is misleading.

 Actually, I'm pretty sure it IS possible to sail faster than the wind with a square sail set perpendicular to the true wind.  However, the vehicle must be constrained to move at some angle to the wind.  Consider an ice-boat one a downwind course 110 degrees off the wind.

 Of course it is relevant. The Laws of Association Football (Law 4) state that the kit colours of the officials must be distinguishable from all other players, including the goalkeepers. It is the referee's sole duty to ensure this, not the match assessor or home club/away club. 

 If necessary, the referee and his assistants change their coloured shirts to ones which do differentiate. Therefore, in the context of a biographical article such as this, it does become notable if the referee fails to carry out his duty (which unfortunately Howard did on this occasion). 

 However, I do admit that it is an ever-increasing sight to see goalkeepers' and officials' garb clashing so obviously!  

 By the way, Howard's three red cards in one match is not the same as a total of three red cards in all previous League Cup Finals - so both statistics should be quoted in the article. And trying to apply """"relevance"""" to a section headed 'Trivia' is like stepping on quicksand.  """

 Q  	   	 Tim (12-14) asks... 

 When my sister gets out of the shower and goes into her room to change I watch her masturbate. There is a hole in the door and I can see right between her legs and sometimes she sticks things in her vagina. Is it OK for me to do this? Is it normal? 
  	  	   
 A  	  	 Tim: 

 Well, your curiosity is perfectly normal. However, I don't think it's okay. First of all, masturbation is a private moment. Second of all, it's your sister  that's not too cool. I suggest that that hole in the door be fixed and you respect your sister's privacy. 

 Q  	   	 Brian (15-17) asks... 

 When I am in Gym, I take a look around at other boys undressing and I get my penis gets stiff. When we are in the shower, it gets even stiffer. I'm not gay, but why is it doing this? 
  	  	   
 A  	  	 Brian: 

 You're getting erections because it turns you on to see other boys undressing, and it turns you on to show them your own penis. Many people (gay and straight) get turned on by sexuality itself, regardless of the subject. True, you may not be gay, but I wouldn't totally rule it out. You should explore in your head what really does turn you on. And like I mentioned to Ryan, above, perhaps you should consider avoiding putting yourself in that situation. 

 Q  	   	 Matthew (15-17) asks: 

 I masturbate 3-4 times a day in private, and maybe once or twice with one or two of my friends. The thing is they only play with themselves once a day, am I normal or am I some kind of sicko? 
  	  	   
 A  	  	 Matthew: 

 Well, as you can read from the other responses, masturbating a few times daily isn't necessarily bad unless it gets in the way of other activities. Now, I assume you don't mean that you masturbate with with your friends every day also? I guess that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but at this point, masturbating 4-6 times per day may be taking time away from other activities. You are probably in the normal range, although most boys don't """"circle jerk"""" that often as they reach their late teens. If you're obsessed with masturbation, or masturbating with your friends, then perhaps you should take up a sport or hobby that will give you something else to do also.

   Deleted User:Soumen_thakur 
    
   Sir, 
    
   Today it was very unfortunate to see that you have deleted my userpage (User:Soumen_thakur)  
   mentioning the reasons: self-gratification, vanity, advert. (Vide deletion log  
   ""Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (Talk | contribs)  
   deleted ""User:Soumen thakur"" ‎ (self-gratification, vanity, advert)"" 
    
   However, I had created said user page clearly following the guideline of  
   wikipedia i.e. how to create a user page and I would like to mention a  
   paragraph from the said guideline as quoted below, 
    
   "".... Some people add information about themselves as well, possibly including  
   contact information (email, instant messaging, etc), a photograph, their real  
   name, their location, information about their areas of expertise and interest,  
   likes and dislikes, homepages, and so forth..... "" 
    
   Therefore, if one mindfully sees the content of the said page (deleted), it  
   will clearly reflect that I have included more of my bio-data related  
   information and about myself on that page but now it becomes confusing that  
   you have deleted the page on the grounds viz. self-gratification, vanity,  
   advert!? 
    
   As far as my knowledge goes I do understand that 'self-gratification' means,  
   'the act of satisfying ones own desires and giving oneself (himself) pleasure'  
   BUT it is not understood how one can even term my ""personal information"" as a  
   self-gratification, instead of treating the same more like a bio-data! Shall  
   I, from now on, treat a 'bio-data' more as a self-gratifying content instead  
   of considering the same as ""personal information""? 
    
   You have also included the term ""vanity"" as one of the reasons for the  
   concerned deletion while, according to my understandings, vanity means,  
   ""excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others""! BUT I  
   do not really understand that how a bio-data like personal information can be  
   interpreted as my excessive belief in my own abilities!? This reason shown by  
   you for the concerned deletion is very confusing to me but it does really  
   enable me to realize what should have been the proper (ideal) page content,  
   can you please throw some light on it? 
    
   And finally, the last reason for deletion stated by you is 'advert' BUT it  
   would be my pleasure to inform you that necessarily an 'advert' is a public  
   promotion of some product or service (generally for commercial purpose) OR a  
   form of communication whose purpose is to inform potential customers about  
   products and services, here please note the term 'customers'. And a customer  
   is generally a buyer. BUT can you please explain me how the deleted user page  
   was displaying my service for commercial purpose. Here, I would like to add  
   that I (rather my business) have more than enough publicity in the print media  
   here in national market and I don't think that placing an advert in the  
   wikipedia user page would be of any commercial gain to me as the effectiveness  
   of any intended advert here is almost nil (if not negative value)! 
    
   Therefore, considering the stated facts and circumstances, I can not really  
   accept that said deletion was at all the act of an efficient administrator,  
   however its my personal interpretation about said act and in this regard, I  
   may not agree with your views. 
    
   So can you please enlighten me explaining what I should have included in my  
   user page so that one would consider the same as a proper or near ideal  
   content? What was wrong with the deleted page, any explanation? 
    
   Thanks & regards, 
   -

 I'm sorry you got caught in the crossfire of my tirade. I was very frustrated when the eighth """"oppose"""" vote came in, and none of them were from regular editors of the page. I do feel like the system is """"gamed"""", especially since there is no move tag for placement on the article. There are tags for most other processes that I perform regularly, including merges and splits. I have perfomed successful moves recently using the prescribed process, but in the majority of the cases they were """"no contests"""", as no one seemed to even notice the issue was being discussed. Granted, some of these were low-traffic aircraft articles, but was was fairly notable. 

 With regard to the moratorium on moving city pages, I seriously was not aware of it, or I would not have proposed the move. That, and the overwhelming opposition, were my primary reason for withdrawing my requests (and the fact I didnt want to see the No votes top 30!) ) As to how I could have been aware of it, I don't know. I did search out other moves, and found no mention of it. Maybe I just missed it, I don't know. What I resented was the implication by another user that I should have somehow known about, in spite of the fact that I have YET to have found it! Even that user did not provide a direct link to it. 

 You can rest assured I won't be proposing any more city moves, regardless of any changes in policy. When I run head on into a buruecratic mess such as this, I leave it alone. I don't warn anon vandals for the same reason; as long as registrations isn't required, anon vandalism will continue. Almost ALL vandalism I have seen comes from anons, yet for whatever reason the higher-ups have not made registration mandatory. So I just stay out of the process altogether, just fix whatever mess they make on pages I edit, and move on. 

 Regarding the move process, the only thing that I can see could be changed is to to have a move tag for the aritcle itself (if there is one, I have not seen it used). I don't know why it's placed on the Talk Page instead, but as mentioned other tags are placed there. 

 As fas as coming down hard on my proposal, all you did was agree with the other reasons given. There were a lot more biting comments addressed towards me, and it was toward them that my anger was directed. Thanks for being the only one to bother to """"reach out"""". It is much appreciated. -  """

People demanding that he explain to them personally every bill, is just a cringe making attempt to humiliate him,and it's vile to read. If you want to humiliate him go and bid for his T shirt on ebay, put your money where your mouths are.

But as things are, it's good if it helps to bring the real issues to the fore. Man uses charitable foundation as personal piggy bank - that is a front page story, and if such an allegation is made by an ex-employee who's not known as a kook, it's not something to be dismissed as """"no story"""". And as to the scales - maybe you can explain exactly what Wales has achieved. In other words, what do you think would be different if Wales had never existed? Do you seriously want to suggest there would be no wiki encyclopedia project today? The idea is trivial. His lucky stumbling into a first-mover position deserves about as much praise as someone making a """"first post"""" on some Internet forum. And, once in that position, how did he handle it? You speak of a success story, well if you measure success by creating a hyped website which is ultimately more comparable to Myspace than to Britannica, then it's a success. As an encyclopedia, it clearly isn't, seeing how its use is banned in many places of learning. (And here yet again can be seen Wales' dishonest evasiveness: he invariably replies to this that such bans are fine because students should not use any encyclopedia - even though one rarely hears of a university banning Britannica, or encyclopedias in general.)    

 ::Jimbo's founding of Wikipedia is very far from a lucky """"being there at the right time."""" The concept of a wiki encyclopedia, open to contribution from all, with content and behavior filtered by evolved community policies, was and is revolutionary. There is no equivalent effort in breadth and scope anywhere. That some people, including educators, issue an outright ban on its use as a resource, reflects on their lack of understanding. Wikipedia's strength is in presenting  relevant reliable sources for each topic, along with some descriptive text, in a reasonably neutral fashion. We are the librarian at a library, providing a client with a suggested reading list and a hopefully neutral overview of the topic. When used properly, this is a powerful resource, complementing Google or other search engines. Jimbo had the vision to bring this forward, and the personality to push it along, to where people have voted it as the ninth most popular site on the Internet, and number one general informational site. This is an accomplishment that nothing and no one can take away from Jimbo, and the world owes him its gratitude.    
 :::You may consider it revolutionary in terms of its impact, but it was still an obvious idea whose time simply had come (it wasn't technically feasible much earlier) and which, if it weren't for him, someone else would have picked up not much later. And he didn't even have that obvious idea. He admitted as much. Originally he only came up with the non-starter Nupedia. He was told about wikis (1) by Larry and (2), so he claims, by some Jeremy Rosenfeld. That there is now no equivalent effort in addition to Wikipedia has to do with the prime-mover advantage I mentioned, since this is a natural monopoly with network effect. To compete against such a thing is like competing against Windows or Ebay. And by God everyone knows Windows is not in its dominant position because it's so good. Now if you want to argue that Wikipedia is mainly providing reading lists, then that's not what an encyclopedia is. An encyclopedia is supposed to provide directly reliable information. Others have suggested before that Wikipedia should just call itself """"Jimbo's Big Bag o' Trivia"""", then no one would be misled.

 Ryanair staff are notorious for behaving rudely to passengers. There have been numerous incidents, including the following which have appeared in the press: 

 using foul and offensive language and attempting to grab a boarding card from a passenger [19]  
 treating passengers dismissively during a security alert. A judge called on Ryanair to issue an apology [20]

  in Ernst Lubitsch's comedy Ninotchka (1939)]] 
 With her last film, George Cukor's Two-Faced Woman (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo's success as a comedienne by casting her in a romantic comedy which sought to portray her as an ordinary girl. She played a double role that featured her dancing the rumba, swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical, although not entirely a commercial, failure. Garbo referred to the film as """"my grave"""". She retired in 1941 at the age of thirty-six after only twenty-seven films made in sixteen years. She was offered many roles in the coming years and showed interest in several, but in each case, she either turned down the part or the project did not come to fruition. 

 In 1948, Garbo signed a contract for $200,000 with producer Walter Wanger, who had produced Queen Christina in 1933, to shoot a picture based on Balzac's La Duchesse de Langeais. Max Ophüls was slated to adapt and direct. Garbo made several screen tests, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize and the project was abandoned. The screen tests—the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera—were thought to have been lost for forty years before resurfacing in someone's garage. Parts of the screen tests were included in the 2005 TCM documentary Garbo."""

 :::Ehh. Chemically I would say that group 4 acts like a main group. Physically I am not sure. Sc, Y, La, and Ac are all soft and reactive metals with typically high melting points (that continue the in-period trend up from groups 1 and 2 pretty well, and also fall going down the group like groups 1 and 2). And they all have electrons relatively far from the nucleus like groups 1 and 2. Lu and Lr have electrons held closer and thus Lu behaves more like a transition metal physically (Lr is predicted to be like Lu). Sc, Y, and Lu are reactive but form stable oxide layers like Mg and Al; La and Ac's oxide layers are only somewhat effective in preventing corrosion temporarily. OTOH Ti, Zr, and Hf are all hard and refactory with high melting points and the oxide layers are all stable and they are all similar (no clear trend going down them).

"025ec4ddfd5fb315",""" 

 Okay, here goes: 

  I do agree that there needs to be an objective, agreed-upon criterion for inclusion.  I also agree that square footage is not a good criterion because many colleges own a lot of land that isn't currently used for academic purposes. 

  Harvard and Tufts really are the extreme cases that warrant inclusion - Harvard has four of its eleven schools in Boston, and Tufts has four of its eight schools in Boston.  My thoughts are that a good criterion is whether there is at least one entire """"school"""" there, being defined as a degree-granting major administrative division of the university. 

  The BU Corporate Education center isn't degree-granting .  I don't see anything about a second major campus in the Northeastern article, and anything outside the 128 wouldn't pertain to this article.  If there are any other cases of an entire degree-granding school being in another city, I'm sure someone would have brought it up already or will add it in the future. 

  I will agree that Tufts spilling over into Somerville doesn't warrant a mention, especially since it seems to be only a small portion of the campus. 

 Again, I don't think that double-barrelled locations for a few institutions will make the list unwieldy, and I do think that there's a clear enough difference between an entire school and the mentioned sattelite centers that there (hopefully) shouldn't be borderline cases.

 ==Removed allegations against county sheriff and other government officials== 
 I have removed a large amount of content from this article in accordance with WP:IINFO and WP:BLP. To summarize some of the principal reasons for deletion (there are others, but these should suffice): 
 * Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Blow-by-blow recounting of events such as the following deleted passage is clearly """"indiscriminate collection of information"""": 
 ::George made several public statements about Spring Hill such as -  
 ***""""I see where we stand on this thing,"""" 
 ***""""They're not supporting the charity program for the rodeo, even though they have an elementary school inside of Spring Hill that is due to benefit from this."""" 
 *** In regard to the ordeal George said """"Bottoms informed me that I should turn the other cheek, so I guess that's what I'll do."""" 
 :Furthermore, incidents of misconduct by high school football players, violations of local sign ordinances, and people shooting the neighbor's dog seldom are sufficiently notable to be mentioned in an encyclopedia, much less described in """"he said, she said"""" detail. 
 * Wikipedia is not a bulletin board or soapbox. Local residents who are outraged at the county sheriff and other local officials may consider their bills of particulars to be important information, but Wikipedia is not the place to tell the world about your issues. 
 * Wikipedia must be very careful about publishing potentially defamatory information about living persons. This means, in part, that negative information must be thoroughly supported by reliable sources (note among other things that incorrect dates are given for the local news articles cited here) and there must not be undue emphasis on negative information. Content such as the following excerpt is unlikely ever to be includable: """"S became enraged and struck K multiple times, pummeling him into the ground.  City Manager RG broke the fight up by putting S into a headlock and helling 'get off of him, you stupid son of a bitch'."""" 
 *Wikipedia must have a neutral point of view.  

 Sections I removed had the following headings: 
 ;Sexual Battery at Spring Hill High School Overlooked in 2004 
 ;Sheriff threatens a suit against the City of Spring Hill in 2004 
 ;Sheriff George Shoots Neighbors Dog in 2005  
 ;Sheriff Accused of violating civil rights in 2005 
 ;Sheriff George Denies deputy of a leave of absence in 2006 
 ;Mt. Pleasant Commissioner Assaulted at Meeting in 2008

 'Mr Hamazono, though, bristled at the suggestion that he and his fellow Tokkotai pilots were the forerunners of modern-day suicide bombers. 

 """"We were completely different,"""" he said. """"We did what we did for our comrades ... the terrorists kill themselves for purely selfish reasons. I don't get angry when I hear them described as the modern-day kamikaze, but it troubles me that religion, not love, inspired them to do these things.' 

 'Missions """"totally different"""" 

 Japan's originals are insulted to be mentioned in the same breath. 

 """"When I hear the comparison, I feel so sorry for my friends who died, because our mission was totally different from suicide bombers,"""" Hamazono says as he strolls through the Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots in Chiran, a former air base on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. 

 The kamikazes attacked military targets. In contrast, """"the main purpose of a suicide bomber is to kill as many innocent civilians as they can,"""" Hamazono says. That, he says, """"is just murder."""" 

 The same distinction is made by other survivors of the Tokkotai, or Special Attack Force, conventionally known as the kamikaze. Its survivors tick off the reasons why their goal-line stand against an American invasion was different from the blind lashing-out of suicide bombers today: 

 • We were ready to die out of love for our country, they say. Suicide bombers are driven by hatred and revenge.'

 Goats Milk Usage in Infant Formulas 

 Much has been written on this topic but the latest scientific opinion from EFSA  supports the use of Goats milk as a source of protein in Infant formula. 

 Following an extensive study the EFSA has ruled that Goats milk is a suitable source of protein in infant formula milk.  

 On the latest evidence from the European Food Standards Agency ( EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies. Scientific Opinion on the suitability of goat milk protein as a source of protein in infant formulae and in follow-on formulae. EFSA Journal 2012;10(3):2603. [18 pp.]. doi:10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2603. Available online: www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal) Goat milk has been found to be an acceptable source of protein in infant formula milk. 
  The idea that Goat milk formula is unsuitable for babies is misleading. Goats milk alone, as is the case with cows milk alone, IS NOT suitable for infants but formulas that meet the regulatory requirements  are suitable."

Is this merely a theoretical figure based on the spectral width of white light or has it been measured? And if the latter, how does one know that the coherence time is actually not determined by the length of the individual light pulses (as given by the individual atomic emissions) rather than the combined bandwidth. I found actually a reference where the coherence length of white light has been measured to be about 200 micrometers, which is subtantially more than the generally quoted value of a few micrometers (see http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0143-0807/24/4/363 ).

My basic proposal is to keep the Poquetanuck article essentially as it is, with no mention of the NRHP HD, and for there to be no redirect from the NRHP HD to this article.  The NRHP HD should show as a redlink in the CT NRHP list-article and in the Preston town article, but not be mentioned at all in the Poquetanuck article (which is odd, but that is my proposal, because it seems too difficult to construct any mention in the Poquetanuck article).  And, further, it is my proposal that there to be no mere NRIS-based NRHP HD stub article created.  And my proposal is also to ask via a template at Talk:Poquetanuck that no one should create the NRHP HD article unless a) a DYK-equivalent length starter article could be created, using substantial information like the NRHP document, and b) the person creating it judges that it is beneficial to have the NRHP HD be a separate article.  I already modified the NRHP list-article's description column to link to the Poquetanuck article, per your suggestion somewhere above.  You create an alternative proposal, and then let's have a limited bit of question and answer about what the proposals are, and then have a vote or whatever, and move on.  Polaron and I have more or less agreed to abide by Acroterion's ultimate decision.  I am assuming that you don't want to get and use the NRHP document before a decision is made.  The decision would be more or less binding on Polaron and me, but I hope you would also agree in advance to abide by it, whatever it is.  If you want to collect and use the NRHP document first before a decision is to be made, please say so.  However otherwise I think we should come to a decision about this one article, within a day or two."

 FEDEQUINAS is the national entity of Colombia that groups and represents Colombian equine associations. It directs, reins, and controls their activities in breeding, exhibition, competition and sport promotion.    

 On 16 January of 1998, though Colombian law number 427, it was tactically recognized as the ruling entity of the Colombian equine guild and commissioned along with the Ministry of Agriculture and rural development as well as the National livestock Fund, to put in place sanitary programs and plans with immediate application, with the end of eradicating diseases that effect livestock, in order to conserve and propagate these pure breeds and comply with international sanitary standards in order to participate in and compete well in the market.  

 On March 16th of 1998 FEDEQUINAS and in accordance with article 4.-, of the law 427, it was declared by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development through resolution no.00053 to open, register and take over the genealogical stud books of the """"Caballo Criollo Colombiano"""" breed with official character.  

 Objectives of FEDEQUINAS: 
 The promotion, improvement, development and strengthening of all the activities linked with the  Creole Colombian Paso Horse both Nationally and Internationally, as the best saddle horse in the world, in his different airs or Creole gaits: the Colombian Paso Fino, the Colombian trot and gallop, the pure Colombian Trocha, and the Colombian Trocha and Gallop.

 I wish also to clarify this paragraph in the article: 

  
  Other historians challenge Ehrenburg's authorship of the infamous """"Kill""""-leaflet. Their arguments are based on the absence of known original Soviet copies of the leaflet from archives and an article by the alleged author in the Krasnaya Zvezda dated November 24, 1944 in which Ehrenburg explicitly denies his authorship of the """"Kill"""" leaflet. [2] (German) A few historians even claim the """"Kill"""" leaflet to be a fabrication of the Nazi Propagandaministerium, invented to strengthen the German resistance during the final months of the war.  

 There is a confusion. The leaflet mention there was a Nazi fake. It also called “Kill” but has another words: 

  
 """"Kill! Kill! In the German race there is nothing but evil; not one among the living, not one among the yet unborn but is evil! Follow the precepts of Comrade Stalin. Stamp out the fascist beast once and for all in its lair! Use force and break the racial pride of these Germanic women. Take them as your lawful booty. Kill! As you storm onward, kill, you gallant soldiers of the Red Army."""" 

 http://www.natvan.com/free-speech/fs983a.html 

  
 This words never were wrote by Ehrenburg. And in his article “Blonde witch” (title hints to Blonde beast = ubermensh) in the Krasnaya Zvezda dated November 25, 1944 Ehrenburg wrote: 

  
 """"There was a time, when Germans used to fake important documents of state. Now they have fallen so low as to fake my articles. The quotes that German general ascribed to me betrayed their’s author: only the German is able to make up this dirty""""

Outside the big three (great white, tiger, bull), all other sharks in the ISAF statistics fall under the category of """"not many attacks"""" and their exact order in the stats is meaningless. Not to mention the source specifically states that ISAF stats are probably wrong for Carcharhinus species and should not be used to gauge how dangerous a particular species is 
 *the number of attacks the great white is responsible for is irrelevant to this article 
 *the 2014 attack in Tathra: the species ID was made by a non-specialist eyewitness and cannot be considered reliable, especially given that even experts have trouble discerning which Carcharhinus species is responsible for an attack. In any case, there's already an example given of a fatal attack (1976 NZ) and there's no need for more 
 *The same goes for the 2011 Bunker Bay attack: non-specialists cannot be considered reliable sources for IDing the species of an attacking shark (""""we were pretty convinced it was a bronze whaler"""" does not constitute proper scholarship) 
 *The fact that 3 of the last 10 New Zealand attacks were by copper sharks gives no insight into the species because it's not generalizable. Is this 3 in 10 figure high? low? typical? These NZ attacks don't even account for a large proportion of the total. It's not important enough to warrant inclusion

After reading articles and evidence and see footage of these concentration camps, my mother admits it was totally wrong and is now seeking a lawyer to sue these bastards for a battery of charges. I’m not going to go into detail here, on Wikipedia, because it’s not a legal site and my words here, on the Talk Page, can be editted and misrepresented in anyway. I agree that Utah should be banned from editting this, but I also suggest that this page gets the strictest lockdown possible. The article is very slanted as almost a promotion and denial of the gulags. Type is Clayton Bowman, a fellow prisoner who was with me, and read about how he was found in near skeleton by the Samoan authories and now lives in a mental ward. How about T.J. Bentley, who was told his whole high school diploma was false and went into drugs very badly, not able to get a job any other way. What about Shane Cortel? Sent two weeks prior to his 18th birthday and forced to stay by lies about a court order till he was 22. His family turned against his mother and rescued him. Then there’s me. I’ve gotten along great because I turned the program against itself, doing research and I’ve now chosen 2007 as a way to TOTALLY strike back. I will DESTORY these bastards. Don’t think I can? Watch me. They’ve been losing lawsuits left and right. BASED ON RESULTS, THEY HAVE EXACTLY WHAT THEY INTEND! I guess they don’t want to be ACCOUN 	 LE for their actions, which they made a CHOICE to enact. Want more? I remember the whole brainwashing scheme, and praise my Catholic/Jewish/Muslim God/Allah (I refuse to acknowledge the Mormon version of my deity because of the abuse I recieved in Paradise Cove/Le Tiera in Western Samoa) that I survived the aftermath and the stay. God/Allah helped me and blessed me with good woman and friends upon my return. I am here, better than ever. Sure, I see the problems of time robbed, but it is God’s/Allah’s will that I return and strike vengeance upon these bastards of Satan. So, what do you want to know? What I starved? You bet! Beaten, butt raped, forced to do oral on men, drink vomit, cum and shit? Yes. Locked and taped in rooms made of wood and concrete with the element persent? Yes. Forced to go into septic tanks to clean them out? Yes. Forced to watch people rape other boys? Yes. I watched kids get kicked and beaten for no reason. But I fought the program 1000% my entire stay. I marched to my own drum, rejected the priciples of the seminars and almost incited a revolution in the Sinalele side of Paradise Cove. How? I read the Bible most of the day, and the Constitution of the United States. Yes, the Constitution gave me hope. Hope that I will destory these bastards. How you ask? Not the law, not the courts. Assassins. I’ll pay Third World mercs and hitmen to kill them. I didn’t need to waste away to a skeleton myself, have food taken from me, or anything, because I refused to go to school. These bastards claim we all lie and are manipulators. Sorry, I didn’t come from a religion hellbent on multiple marraiges to my sister and try to smooth talk my way out that. Mormons are those kind of talkers. I am ashamed so much of being a Republicans that I might go Democrat and Liberal to prevent these hellspawns from operating. I am dead serious about it. Furthermore, I admit to being a hit-and-run poster, so don’t expect me to post anymore on this. NOTE: I SUGGEST THIS ARTICLE BE LOCKED DOWN. Seriously."

 ::I have no particular insight into how Nightscream selected his list of people to notify. I do know that he elected to notify a list of people he selected rather than add neutral notices somewhere like WikiProject Biography; presumably, his selection criterion is based on who would support his viewpoint. A larger point is that his canvassing notice explicitly encourages people to skip earlier discussion - that is definitely non-neutral, because ten months earlier he claimed there were many unreferenced items here, and it evaporated for the same reason - that the items he claimed were unreferenced had references. Telling editors to please just ignore that is definitely not a neutral solicitation - that is why the notice above was originally at the top of this section, to catch people's eye before they skipped over it. —   """

The only thing that makes this program sustainable is that its proprietor can """"restart"""" it by switching from a Ponzi scheme (2% per day payout) to a pyramid scheme (matrixes where $80 comes in on the bottom level and $60 is paid out on the top level). Both of these schemes operate by taking money from people within the program to pay people within the program, although the pyramid scheme part actually pays out less by funneling money to the operators. JBP meets both the definition of an HYIP by promising unrealistically high returns in a short period of time (as a Ponzi scheme) and the definition of a pyramid scheme by generating income purely from within the program.

"02ff79e2ea6055ff","== New categories in Education == 

 Hello - I started to revert some of your edits, but thought that before I went any further I'd engage in some discussion here, as I think there may be some way forward. I notice you created new categories: 
 *Teacher associations based in the United Kingdom 
 *Category:Standardised tests in the United Kingdom 
 However, I'm not sure if these are the best titles for these as the articles you've included in them do not really fit these categories. For example, in Teacher assoc's you have included the Graduate & Registered Teacher Programmes which are training programmes linked to various establishments, rather than associations. Similarly, you had listed QTS which is actually a qualification / status rather than association. 
 In the standardised tests cat you have included all the Key Stage articles, while these are actually periods of study, not tests of qualifications in themselves. 
 As I say, my temptation is to remove these articles from these cats, but perhaps you'd rather relabel the cats if you think it's worth keeping those articles together?    

 :Thanks for your message! I started out at Category:Charities based in the United Kingdom which was packed full and not making use of already created sub-categories. On sorting them down, a number of educational related articles appeared in many areas, including: independent schools; teacher groups; student groups; research, etc. From a practical point of view, most of the independent schools are charities, so those that had just been placed in the top category were sorted downwards into the new category Category:Educational charities based in the United Kingdom. I didn't create any new categories which didn't already have an existing country split somewhere in that created line, mainly from United States principle- ie: I just copied that structure, not creation of a new structure. Having got that down, I then moved onto Category:Organisations based in the United Kingdom. Again, a number of educational organisations appeared, which had been over categorised - again, I followed the existing country split, mainly form existing US splits. After nearly two days of sorting, I am sure I have probably miss-sorted a couple of articles, so if you think an article should sit in a different category, then please feel free to sort it across. But please don't push it back up to Category:Education in the United Kingdom - it was a mess! If you need some help, please just ask. Best Regards,"

 == Long-term sockpuppetry violates Internet Service Porviders' """"Terms of Service"""" == 

 I have been around here long enough now to see the countless hours put into chasing sockpuppets and their dynamic IP addresses.  As you know, Internet Service Providers have strict """"Terms of Use/Service"""" agreements with their customers.  In these TOS agreements, it clearly states that if the customer uses the ISP services to damage or destroy websites, or for other harassing type of behavior on the Internet, then their service will be terminated.  So, after years of chasing some of these """"banned users"""" here on Wikipedia, I think a good case could be presented to an Internet Service Provider that one of their customers is doing great damage harassing the Wikipedia project and wasting the resources of Wikipedia.  All you would have to show is a history of damage/harassment done by the sockpuppet/dynamic IP and the exact times the IP made those edits identified as vandalism, then the ISP could trace it back to a particular customer and terminate their service.  Obviously this would only be used in extreme cases which have gone on for many months or years. I'm certain someone at Wiki must have thought of this before, so what is the problem with implementing this as policy on Wiki?   """

 :Yes, I agree. However I seem to recall that User:PHG tends to believe that the entire Mahayana movement stems from Hellenic influence, and Wikipedia has a systemic bias towards this due to the amount of work he has spent promoting these ideas. Eg: This inscription represents one of the first known mention of the Buddha as a deity, using the Indian bhakti word Bhagavat (""""Lord"""", """"All-embracing personal deity""""), suggesting the emergence of Mahayana doctrines in Buddhism.  and The Mahayana movement probably began around the 1st century BCE in northwestern India, at the time and place of these interactions. According to most scholars, the main sutras of Mahayana were written after 100 BCE, when sectarian conflicts arose among Nikaya Buddhist sects regarding the humanity or super-humanity of the Buddha and questions of metaphysical essentialism, on which Greek thought may have had some influence: """"It may have been a Greek-influenced and Greek-carried form of Buddhism that passed north and east along the Silk Road"""" (McEvilly, """"The shape of ancient thought"""").

هاي کوتاه که در هريک از اونا کليدي براي آشکار سازي مراحل و موضوعات و درواقع عملکردهاي سياست نوين بود مطمئنا نغمه در اجراي هر مرحله از سياست نوين ترسيده يا جا ميزنه هروقت بعد پشيمون ميشه و بر مي گرده يا مسئولين ايران ممانعت مي کنند از فعاليت هاش در بسياري از مواقع از اين ممانعت ها ممکنه شاد بشين که يک مانع محکم در مقابل اجراي اهداف و فعاليت هاتون و حتي قدرت طلبي هاتون برداشته شده اما بايد بگم که در مقابل اين طرز فکر شما من هيچ درصد احتمالي مشخص نخواهم کرد چون همه اين شگردها درواقع تکنيکي از سياست نوين براي پيشبرد هر مرحله از اون هست در سياست نوين هدف برداشتن گام هاي آهسته اما با درصد عملي شدن بالا هست و در واقع فعاليت هاي بنده فقط مختص اين مباحثات نميشه و بخش خبري من هم محدود به اخبار ملي در کشور نميشه و هيچ کس حتي مسئولين دولت خودم هم نمي توانند در مقابل سياست نوين من کوچکترين اقدام ممانعت آميزي انجام بدن حتي اين سياست نوين مانع از اين شده که کوچکترين خطر جاني منو تهديد کنه حتي ترور در واقع مي تونم بگم شروع اين سياست نوين يک تحول اساسي در شگرد و عملکردهاي من و درواقع يک پوسته محافظتي در برابر من شد به حدي که حتي مسئولين دولت ايران حتي مي ترسند که به من نزديک بشن فکر کنم در ارتباط با سياست نوين به اندازه کافي صحبت کردم بنابراين خيلي سريع وارد اصل مطلب ميشم اول از همه ميخوام بدونم بين شما و دولت ايران چه مي گذره؟ممکنه شما جواب بدين اين ارتباط بين من و دولت ايران درواقع يک سياست بازرگاني و حتي قدرتي براي مقابله با استعمار جهاني و....و....و.... و اما من در مقابل اين جوابتون مجددا سئوال خواهم کرد اما اين بار با جديت بيشتر که بين شما و دولت ايران چه مي گذره؟بعد شما جواب خواهيد داد که چرا اين سئوال رو مي پرسم و من حال علت رو به عرضتون مي رسونم.قبل از عنوان علت باز ممکنه براتون جاي سئوال باشه اين شگرد سئوال و جواب دادن يعني چي و من براي چي خيلي راحت از اول علت رو نگفتم اين تکنيک درواقع براي بيان علتي هست که در ادامه متن مباحثه بهش خواهيد رسيد حال علت ...آقاي پوتين من و شما زياد ميونه خوبي با هم نداريم ديدگاه روانشاسي ميگه بيشترين شناخت روي آدما در زمانيکه با هم روابط خوبي ندارن و خصومت آميز ايجاد ميشه چون حس اعتماد از بين رفته و افراد در کوک اين هستن که با شناخت روي هم بتون هم ضربه خوبي به طرف مقابل بزنن هم خودشونو از ضربات حفظ کنن.با گفته بايد بگم من خوب شما رو ميشناسم شما هم منو پس بهتره پنهان کاري ها ور بزاريد کنار و خيلي روراست به سئوالم جواب بدين من مطلب رو بازتر ميکنم که بهتر متوجه بشين.دولت ايران از زمانيکه وارد رابطه با شما شده زمانش هم مال الان نيست خيلي وقته مي تونم بگم از زمان انقلاب به بعد از لحاظ توليدات کاهش به جاي روند افزايشي کاهش پيدا کرده اينو از اينجا در جواب به رسانه هاي ملي ايران ميگم اگه حتي ايران بياد از پيشرفتهاي داروييش بگه از پيشرفت هاي علميش بگه من اين حرف رو خواهم زد چون تو ايران هستم و شاهد تمام قضايا و پنهان کاري هايي که ضررشو دارم به چشم خودم ميبينم در کشور هستم حالا من نميخوام مشکلات کشور ايران رو اونم در پست به شما عنوان کنم و نه مشکلات هيچ کشور ديگه رو در پيج مسئولين کشور ديگه چون اين خلاف قوانين هدف اصلي من يعني صلح جهاني هست.من در اينجا ميخوام اينو عنوان کنم به عرضتون از زمانيکه روابط ايران با شما تشکيل شده دولت ايران ميزان توليداتش به شدت کاهش پيدا کرده مسئولين دولت ايران مدام از کمبود بودجه حرف ميزنند و حال گران شدن قيمت دلار باعث خوشحاليشون شده چون بالا بردن قيمت ارز باعث ميشه ميزان بودجه دولت در اثر خريد دلار بره بالا و اين موجب ميشه قسمت اعظم اين قيمت ها مجدد در خريد محصولات و توليدات از خارج به داخل بشه و مسلما يکي از کشوراي مبادله کننده شما خواهيد بود واين موجب ميشه مجدد لطمه به قشر توليد کننده کشور وارد بشه ممکنه بپرسيد از به ما چه ربطي داره دولت ايران خودش درخواست ميکنه آره مسلما در اينجا به شما ربطي نخواهد داشت اما من در مقابل حرفتون خواهم گفت من هم براي نرسيدن شما به اهداف استعماري تون که خبر هم دارم دولت ايران باهاتون متحده اما حتي اگه دولت خودم هم متحد شما باشه من نخواهم گذاشت هم به هدفتون برسيد هم کاري خواهم کرد که از به دنيا آمدنتون پشيمون بشيد براي انجام اين کار نيازي به اسلحه و سلاح اتمي ندارم سلاح من قوه بيانم هست و صداقتم و مبتني بر اون خيلي راحت مي تونم با برترين قدرت هاي جهاني بدون کوچکترين ترس و واهمه اي به مبارزه بپردازم اينو گفتم که شناختتون رو من بيشتر بشه حالا دلم ميخواد خيلي زيبا تمام چيزهايي که مي دونيد رو به زبان بياريد نگران اينکه خدايي ناکرده دولتتون به خطر بيوفته و منافعتون نباشيد هدف من نابودي هيچ دولتي نيست و با شروع سياست نوين نخواهم گذاشت که هيچ دولتي ساقط بشه حتي اگه هم در شرفش باشه ازش جلوگيري ميکنم.ببنيد تا اونجا که مي دونم شما با دولت ايران مبادلات کالايي و مواد غذايي داشتين اولا من با مواردي که از عملکردهاتون دبدم متوجه شدم هدفتون چي بوده اما علت عنوان اين مطلب به خاطر روشن و يادآوري خصومت هاي گذشته بين من و شما و دولتتون نبوده چون با شروع سياست نوين درواقع"

 Thank you Mr. Dunning, I appreciate your help and also your assistance on the Barbaro page. For what it is worth, both Fenwick and the Barbaro family at their fullest were the most complete and accurate, and we again  apolagize for your troubles.  

 *Mr. Dunning, I am sorry to bother you again, But I must insist that you allow me to go into both talk pages and edit certain personal information out. You are now well informed about has happened, and there are individuals who are posting info not quite right and don't understand what has happened. Please understand my edits. Thank you, Barbaro family 

 *P.S. please also notify all others about the situation 

 Thank you Mr. Dunning all of that nonsense had no value anyways, it was just a cover up, the kid knew that when he named the Vitus Barbaro, it would open the door to the Barbaro family, and the family does review this page from time to time for accuarcy. It was completely accurate before, as was Fenwick's. But he got made when he named the so-called head who is truely the head of the Barbaro family but not the head of that bogus group that it would all come back to him. When someone flagged Fenwick's page, and substantially changed the Barbaro page, he knew V.V.(the family head of the Barbaro family) would go into the discussion group and find out why. V.V. is furious for what this kid has done, and I ask you to please restore both the Barbaro page and Fenwick's page with his reference in as it was. V.V. deserves to be justly there. Don't worry this is being dealt with this and it won't happen again! 

 The Barbaro Family talk page now has all Hoax matter removed, and I have left eveything that was written pertaining to the family's subject matter in tact. 

 I would also like to help you out by going over the whole Barbaro article with a fine tooth comb for you to establish validity. I also want to provide the proper ISBN numbers for all sources, so those out there using the page as a guide for research will also have that information as well. Once I am done with that I will also come to Fenwick's page and help you out hear as well. Thank you Mr. Dunning

 Hello Mr. Dunning, I reviewed the page for accuracy by checking sources as well as emailing the school for further verification of the material and to even have their confirmation if what was written on Wikipedia is accurate. The citation for the architect does check out. There is a record of the architect who designed the school on file which was faxed and the Notre Dame source previously given does reference him as previously cited. Go on line and search """"Notre Dame100 Years:contents"""". The actual chapter from the book Notre Dame 100 Years by Arthur J. Hope is on line. I went to www.ivysport.com and listened to both the Fenwick song and Yale's. There a central portion to Yale's march that is incredibly close and almost identical to Fenwick song. That reference is also true. Also when you check out www.ivysport.com you neeed to find the right page, some are about clothes and other memorabilia. The one with the song also confirms who the writers of the song were as well. That source also checks out. As for Vitus Barbaro, He is fully recorded in in the Goldenbook that sorce checks out. There is also another record of the family in Spretti and in the Almanac de Gotha. His education is recorded and work as an engineer/car designer as well, and all of those details that were on the Barbaro page before, also including his arms, Grand Prince corronet of Transylvania etc. They even show the arms of Transylvania and the arms of Catanzaro. He has also been a producer in Hollywood as well. He contributed to the E! True Hollywood Series Young Royals that aired on Thanksgiving 2006. There is also a record of him through the Kentucky Derby Association- he is into horse racing- Roy Jackson, the owner of """"Barbaro"""" the horse, which you can guess why Vitus would be close to that, was  personally contacted about Barbaro's development after the horse's Preakness injury. There is also a record of that, a hand witten letter sent to Vitus by Roy Jackson himself addressing Vitus by one of his titles as """"N.H. Count Vitus Sebastian Barbaro"""". The letter sent to him by Roy Jackson is on record and is also written on official Lael Farms Barbaro Jockey Letterhead. There is also a record of Vitus with Ferrari including a letter written from Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo to him on December 3, 1997 on official Ferrari leterhead and mailed out by the Ferrari postoffice in Maranello that also has an official Ferrari and city of Maranello 410"

 === CNN Report on Genocide === 

 http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-591938?ref=feeds%252Flatest 

 Freedom songs calling for civil war? 

 iReport — Johannesburg, South Africa - In a country that have been divided for decades over the issue of race it would seem that a new form of Apartheid has been given birth to. Since the fall of Apartheid in South Africa and post 1994 democratic elections a rise in murders and attacks on white South Africans have been at the order of the day. Farm attacks is a huge concern for the minority white community. The government of South Africa ruled by the ANC has imposed affirmative action laws in government and private sector. This forces bussinesses to employ black people before whites. Since the majority of South Africans are black the job market has become a slaughterhouse of white youths. Ill-skilled black South Africans are apointed in senior positions within government and elsewhere. This is leading to corruption, mismanagement and economic meltdown of the South African economy. 
 The new concern for both white and black South Africans are the ideals of ANC Youth League President Julius Malema. Mr Malema is seen as a joke by a lot of people, some see him as a hero for Black Nasionilism, and others see him as a threat to Democracy. Malema is being in court lately for charches of hate speech. The song sung by Malema at many ANC meetings, 'kill the boer, kill the farmer' has put him at public enemy #1 for most white South Africans. Due to the increase of horror murders and  violent attacks on whites the song are blamed for this. 
 Can you put yourself in the shoes of a white person in South Africa and hear on the news and streets how thousands of black South Africans are singing songs that they want to kill you. The word """"Boer"""" are often used to describe Whites born in South Africa. The Police Force of pre-1994 was also sometimes called the boers by non-whites in South Africa. It is also a very big concern that the ANC Senior Management have now come out to support Mr Malema in court stating that these songs are struggle songs and must not be forgotton. It is however almost twenty years since the fall of Aaprtheid and Mr Malema was barely a teenager when Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa. So no one really understand what struggle Malema is singing about since he has been free for the last 20 years of his 30 years since birth. He is living the life of a playboy in South Africa having dinners at luxury hotels and clubs, having body guards ect. 
 The questions now remains, since the ANC Goverment is openely supporting Malema in singing songs of genocide, what will become of the minority whites in South Africa? Will killing of whites be the last or will Asian, Arabic and all other ethnic groups also be next for not being Black Africans? Is South Africa going to survive an uprise and civil war? Is the world going to watch a country killing its citizens based on the colour of their skins. Is South Africa becoming the next Nazi Germany ruled by a fanatic such as Malema? Only time will tell.

"033e6d33b4ff544b",""":I think when surveys of critical reception all agree that a film has reviewed well or poorly then there is no harm in saying that, because a lot of readers will expect to find a nutshell summary of the critical reception. The problem is when these surveys come to different conclusions, with some finding the reception mixed or positive, or even describing it as lukewarm. In the case of The Hobbit we have something of a split decision: most surveys are saying the reception was either mixed or reserved in its praise, but to say the reception is """"mixed to positive"""" is WP:SYNTHESIS, because these surveys themselves aren't actually saying that. I think in cases like this we should perhaps emphasize the incongruity, and introduce the section with something along the lines of """"Critical opinion has been split on An Unexpected Journey. A, B, C consider the critical opinion to be mixed, while D, E, F regard it has lukewarm or generally positive"""". Our jobs as editors are to summarize, not to draw to conclusions.

 :My claim is that the English language definition of the word """"royal"""" does not mean """"must be descended from god."""" I am arguing that the term royal is accurate and is entirely consistent with the Al-Sabah family, as described by you and Michael Herb. 

 :My disagreement with you is on English language definitions, not Islamic culture. 

 :Your explanations about Islamic cultural norms include the implicit assumption that the word """"royal"""" includes """"descended from god"""" as part of its definition. If, as I assert, that isn't an integral part of the definition, then it calling the Al-Sabah's the """"Kuwaiti Royal Family"""" does not go against cultural norms at all. 

 :It is also important to be aware of your audience. Wikipedia is not a place for formal academic papers. When I am writing a paper in my field, computer science, I write using the formal terminology of the field. The audience of the paper is formal academia. When I am writing for a non-academic audience, I will use different terminology. I will avoid words that we have re-defined or defined especially narrowly, since I know that those definitions are only meaningful within the appropriate context. 

 :Wikipedia is supposed to be written in standard English. Correctness and accuracy are supposed to be achieved using language that is understandable by people who are not academics in the field of the article. 

 :From what I understand of your statements, your portion of the academic community has taken the standard English language definition for the word """"royal"""" and added an additional requirement, """"descended from god."""" 

 :Think through the implications of your idea: You're going to write your text with, in your mind, certain definitions for your words. However, since your audience, while educated, is not a part of your academic field, they'll think the words you're using mean something else. You're saying that this is clearer and more accurate? That's ridiculous. Clarity and accuracy come from the reader and writer using the same definitions for words. 

 :Your more formal and more accurate word re-definitions are, I'm sure, useful and valuable when you are discussing this topic within academic circles. Wikipedia is not one of those circles. 

 :I hope this at least makes my position clearer. I would sincerely appreciate it if you could stop trying to portray me as somehow being anti-intellectual or anti-academia.

The USPSTF are very specifically targeted at telling clinicians what to tell patients, whereas the PHE have a wider remit, advising on regulation for example. But they are prepared to, in effect, recommend e-cigs, though I heard one of the authors complaining that the licensed drugs + counselling aren't used more.  The very limited RCT evidence so far does suggest that this is more effective than e-cigs, but the ceasing consumer doesn't seem to agree, and may be right. Considering all the fuss the question has generated in the US for some years, it's remarkable no one has yet done a proper head to head RCT there - nothing in it for pharma I suppose.

 I was not 'abusing' the speedy delete tag. At the time I added the tag, it was a plaintext (not standard WP font, don't know how it managed that) dictionary definition, was therefore not encyclopedic and therefore qualified for speedy delete.   
 *Plaintext is not a speedy criterion, and neither is dictionary definition.   
 **Not being encyclopedic is

 ****Articles #1: '# Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., """"He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great."""").'. At the time I added the tag, the plaintext formatting (no line breaks) meant that the article was a single, incomplete sentence [the rest of it wasn't displayed]. This means that it qualified for CSD under the criterion I have linked to.   
 *****I really don't think this criterion was intended to get articles deleted merely because their contributor is unaware of wikipedia's formatting system, but I will make a note of your interpretation.   
 ****** As I have already said (I'll repeat, since it's clear from your failed RFA that you're an arch-inclusionist), the formatting was not the reason I added a speedy delete tag to this page. very short articles containing little or no context are speedy deletion candidates, regardless of the reason.

 == The harm of articles == 

 According to my logic, every article has cost, and what we're buying with that cost is maintaining or increasing article quality.  The set of books that meet our notability guidelines is huge, but still small enough that the community is willing to tolerate low-quality articles in hopes that they will be improved sooner rather than later.  If you expand the pool of potential articles to any published book, we're going to be inundated with low-quality articles, most of which won't ever be improved (not the least because, in the absence of reliable sources, we have nothing to say about them other than the fact that they exist).   

 If you want to take responsibility for all aspects of an article, from polishing the prose to making sure every WP:MOS-mandated em-dash is in the right place, and you do this before you put the article in to mainspace, then in my experience you'll be given quite a bit more leeway (especially in non-controversial areas).   

 There's one more reason the """"does no harm"""" argument is annoying.  In the time it's taken for us to have this colloquy, you could have gone out and found a few of the reviews that I found.  """"Does no harm"""" absolves you from having to improve the article.  If you want to !vote to keep an article, you'll be much better served by improving the article to the point where it's obvious that the article should be kept.

 == Aristotle's nationality inadequately adressed == 

 After reading the article on Aristotle and reading some archival material regarding Aristotle's nationality, I have concluded that no one (including moderators) have sufficiently answered this issue: Was Aristotle Greek or Macedonian? Moderators tend to simply shut down other individuals arguments one way or another, but make no sufficient conclusion. Thus, I present to you some of the information which should be adressed in order to pursue a more accurate conclusion of Aristotle's origin. 

 According to the Penguin Books Classics publisher's historical biography of Aristotle in several of their (current) published Aristotle texts, Aristotle is designated as being Macedonian - not Greek - due to the (supposed) facts that: 1. he never spoke Greek since the current form of the Greek language was undeveloped. Rather, he spoke a tribal language of Vlach origin 2. While some simplistic historic accounts render ancient Macedonia as a Greek city-state, more accurate accounts reveal that Macedonia was considered by the Greeks to be a barbaric savage-land 3. Aristotle was chased out of Athens due to his Macedonian origins by an anti-Macedonian mob. This forced Aristotle to live out the remainder of his life in exile. 4. Macedonians were originally of Vlach, Trachi and Illiri (in addition to 4 or 5 other tribes, I cannot recall the names) tribe origins. In later centuries, slavic people began moving to Macedonia, however, there still exists a genetic connection between many contemporary Macedonians and the original 7 or 8 tribes. Aristotle supposedly had Vlach and Illiri descendants, accounting for the fact that he spoke a non-Greek language. 

 Keep in mind, that these are not my assertions, but rather, the assertions of a reliable publisher and source, Penguin Books. And if any moderators attempt to claim that this source is """"unreliable"""", I should like to remind them that Wikipedia has yet to have earned the recognition of being reliable. I would find it hard to believe that any adequately educated individual would not recognize the unreliability of Wikipedia. High schools and universities alike have restricted students from using Wikipedia due to its """"butchering of the nuance-related or obscure facts."""" 
 Perhaps, if Wikipedia staff members and writers strived to be more accurate in their articles (and I certainly hope that they do), Wikipedia would be well on its way to scholarly recognition."""

 ...was I wrong to laugh hysterically for 5 straight minutes after reading this sentence?   

 the phrase 'shit stirrer' is used throughout england, or at least in the north west; not only london and the surround SHIT GLORIOUS SHIT WE JUST CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT  

 I agree that 'shit stirrer' is more of a phrase from the North West of England. If anything, I've only ever heard it used around Manchester and Lancashire - certainly not in the London area. 

 It's used in the North east too, primarily by Geordies. 

 ==The Shitten Shepherd== 
 Rather than the past participle, shitten makes more sense as describing the state of being soiled. Take the original line: 
 For if the priest be foul in whom we trust, no wonder that a common man should rust, and shame it is to see, let priests take stock, a shitten shepherd and a snowy flock.

 == This article is locked? == 

 I wanted to make a grammatical change to a sentence in this article, but it's locked.  

 In the first paragraph, there is a sentence that says: 

 """"Shit or shite is a vulgar word in Modern English vulgarly denoting feces."""" 

 Is the second mention of the vulgar nature of the word shit necessary? It makes the sentence seem improper to me.   

  
 Added Later: 

 I verified my email address... and suddenly the edit links have appeared. I'm going to go ahead and make the change I suggested above. 

 == I always used Shite Differently from Shit == 

 Shite for me is more continuous, less aggressive and more commonly dismissive.: 'How was the gig? - Shite.'  Just common place bad. 

 How was the gig? - Shit. Far stronger. 

 Anyone else find this?   

 Shite (pronounced with the I as in eye rather than the i as in Indian) is, I believe, a Scottish pronunciation,   

 Well in London shite as in sh'eye'te is just as commo"

 :Hi. Well, in my opinion USA has both Force and Justice on their side in this case. By """"Justice"""" I don't mean human legal system. I mean Justice, as one of the highest principles (I have to mention this because it seems I wasn't quite clear about that in the previous post, so you misunderstood it).  I have to admit I don't quite see what you're trying to do with mentioning again UN Charter and other documents. I've already said - those are lists of UN wishes. It's not a law per se, and thus it is not convenient to use the word """"guarantee"""". UN is in no position to guarantee anything. UN can use a Force just like any single nation, but what they do is not """"legal"""", and I already explained that in the previous post. UN works on a mob principle, similar to democracy. If you have Force strong enough to impose something, and a will behind that Force, then you do it. If not, you don't. My parallels with French revolution are very much relevant, and I would still like to hear your answer: do you support French revolution and democracy or not, even though such a thing was """"illegal"""" then as much as Kosovo is illegal today? Also, do you consider USA an 'illegal' state, considering that their independence was illegal? And one more thing regarding legality - do you consider invasion of Iraq legal, and if not, what is UN doing in punishing the countries who invaded Iraq? If UN cannot or does not want to punish countries that invaded Iraq, your whole point of """"UN law"""" or """"International law"""" goes down the drain, instantly. One of the requirements of """"law"""" is having a Force strong enough to impose it, and to make sure everyone obeys it. If there is no Force sufficient to ensure adherence to the law, then there is no law - it's a list of good wishes. One can then say that independence of Kosovo is against the wishes of some, but that hardly has any relevance at all when those whose wishes are for the independence are stronger. Back to your post. I agree with you that UN was made to protect stability and peace, and that's why I don't like UN. If UN was there to manifest Justice, I would support it. As it is, I don't respect UN, and I think not respecting UN is a good thing (you made it sound like it's a bad thing). To answer your question: not every minorities want independence, and those minorities who want it should get it. That's right, if Istria in my country wanted independence I'd be among the first to vote in their favor. I have entirely different concept when it comes to self-determination of minorities. I reject the idea of national state, I think it's a flawed concept which was historically useful as much as democracy was historically useful and as mush as the tyranny of Peisistratos was useful. It's not a concept that's in itself good, but it's a concept which helped bring a civilization to the next level. I wanted to make explanation a bit longer but this section of Wikipedia doesn't allow it so I won't bother. To sum it up: I think a country should be run so well, that no one in their right mind would even want to break-off. And if someone does want to break-off for whatever reason, an economic (and other) alliance should be made to neutralize bad side effects of having too many small countries (a concept similiar to USA or EU). Oh, and regarding the last part of your msg - I repeat, there is no such thing as 'relevant international law'. Also, """"whether the law is enforced or not, that's another story"""" is a very strange figure of speech, since a law that is not enforced is not a law at all. It's a list of good wishes.   """

You're the irrational one by insisting without proper investigation that such phenomena is automatically bogus.  And shame on the next dude for just parroting a false and malicious conclusion.  You show forth your stupidity in the most abberant manner.  I am a real scientist and I have examined what evidence is available to me regarding claims about Therese Neumann.  She was a Saint and her phenomena proof of the truth of Catholicism, which she herself indicates by her manner of life.  She's not an isolated case.  There's thousands of well-documented and reliable accounts of modern and past supernatural phenomena on the part of Catholic Saints that backs up their claims that Jesus founded the Catholic Church and that it's the only true religion. 

 Everybody with wisdom realizes Wikipedia has a heavy liberal bias and won't give us the truth on almost anything.  Giving both sides of the story here is not truth.  Therese Neumann is one of thousands of messages from God to the world that it should be Catholic. 

 And Neumann, if the yogi dude isn't lying, probably either didn't understand his words (Eastern religious jargon) or just wanted to be nice and not cause a fight.  If he wanted her opinion, in Western cultures, you ask the person straight-forward.  Hinduisms are not at all like Catholicism.  Hinduisms are more like 'I think I am one, therefore I am'.  Catholics are Catholics only if they do and say what the Church defines that Catholics do.  E.G. murderers commit a mortal sin and stop being Catholics.  And I'll be honest with you, guys like that would lie about what she said just to use her for their scheme.  It seems more in line with what honest people record her saying that she told him he'd go to Hell if he didn't become a Catholic.

 == Revan as a female is not canon == 

 I realize Atton initially introduces Revan as female in KotOR II, but what he's saying is just what he thinks. As he says when you tell him Revan is a male, he wants to think that Revan's female, because as we can tell from Atton's character (especially if you play as a female Exile), he's always looking for female attention. Therefore, we can safely conclude that Atton has no idea what sex Revan is, and that he simply opened with Revan as female due to wishful thinking.  """

"03dff1dfd0effa6a","""this article does not belong in the Wikipedia Philosophy Project == 
 (1) To be considered as a physicist fit for inclusion in wikipedia, the candidate must """"be"""" a physicist on a commonsense basis. 

 (2) Neutrality (NPOV) means that the best way of determining whether the candidate is a physics is to look for formal certification and a near universal peer acceptance such that even physicists who disagree with the candidate's results admit that so and so is a physicist. They should say when his name is mentioned, """"oh, yes, Jenkins...heard of chap...did some interesting work...bit of a bounder"""", not """"good God man, keep him off the grounds"""". 

 (3) The """"Caesar's Wife"""" rule applies where that rule (""""Caesar's wife must be above suspicion"""") means that the acceptance as a physicist must be close to 100%. 

 (4) Philosophical candidacy for treatment as a philosopher and for inclusion in the Wikipedia Philosophy Project must be as strict as the above rules for physicists. To not make this a requirement would disrespect an older field, and open it, as far as wikipedia is concerned, to a variety of cracker-barrel philosophers and head cases. 

 (5) Because doing philosophy requires a dangerously high committment to following truth, and because this committment needs to be in excess of, and opposed to, the requirements of an unjust capitalist order, the only extant philosophers are college professors, seeking or having earned tenure. Therefore, a learned seat in an accredited institution should also be a requirement. I have no doubt that this will stick in the craw of pre-wealth majors, jerks, head cases, and other mere students who unconsciously or consciously seek to destroy the university from within: (x)[isAphilosopher(x) -> isAprof(x)]. Suck on it. 

 But: 

 (1) Rand is thought to be a writer of popular novels by the educated public, not a philosopher. 

 (2) I am unaware that she had any academic connections in her life. The academic nexus today is thin and appears to consist of wealthy donors who support her mad ideas funding Rand studies, and professional philosophers wearily addressing her errors as one way of teaching philosophy to moronized Randroids in Philosophy 101 for Boneheads. 

 (3) She famously refused to encounter the thought of other philosophers such as Kant who bugged her.  

 (4) The """"Caesar's Wife"""" rule in her case, in which a significant number of """"real"""" philosophers think she's no philosophers, and in which many people think she was a head case, applies. If Oxford dons could some time ago issue """"non placet"""" in the course of denying Derrida (the French philosopher who bugged THEM), then this rule can be applied to Rand. Substantively and after reading Derrida, I think that the dons were wrong: after investigating Rand, I give her a non placet. But the """"Caesar's Wife"""" rule in her case means that because there is a critical mass of people who don't think Rand is """"almost"""" a philosopher, or a """"bad"""" philosopher, but a head case, she needs to be removed from the Wikipedia Philosophy Project.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by

 Although there is some relationship between the Gutenberg project and Librivox... I'm not sure why the link to """"computer-generated"""" Audio Books on Gutenberg is present... Librivox has nothing to do with Gutenberg's computer-generated files.  In fact, Librivox is philosophically opposed to """"computer-generated"""" readings of literature.  The prevailing opinion at Librivox is that literature is better presented through the human voice.  While this may be a helpful link for those looking for Audio Books, it really has little to do with Librivox (the subject of the page).

"0404fc8e39aa100d","==zoroasterian false claims== 

 It is rediculous to claim that Zoroaster proclaimed Ahura Mazda as the monothiest god of manking for the first time in history in the times of Cyrus and the father of King Darius the great around 700 BC. 
 It is more rediculous that in no time Zoroaster declared yet another unborn god Ahriman yet as another god hence Dualism. 

 It is known that the first ever writings of Zoroaster was his dream of seeing Ahuramazda the one god well known so to the iranians for time immmemorial , then declaring seeing another god like a shadow to ahura mazda in the second dream two weeks later as he writes. 

 It is well known that Zoroaster is the first man claiming another unborn god hence he is the father of dualism. he was no revealed religins-prophet like monothiestic religion (Noah, Abraham=Judaism, christianity and islam) for he declares getting his knowledge from dreams never spoke to god or a messenger of god). It is impossible to dissociate Ahoramazda from Magusis the adherants of Dualism, of whom King Darius the Great clearly declared a war on them by killing the Magusi sardis the usurpur of the kingship and declaring a yearly day celebration called (the day of the killing of the magusi Magimortis) in which he allowed his people to kill any magusi (dualism adherant) in that day even in the magusi;s own house, this is why magusis used to hide in that day in other places in that day of the year. 

 Obviously  much later after Darius the Great  that the Magusis (adherants of Zoroaster) managed to take control of the great Persian kingdum) which caused its demise , the magusis continued control of the poor persian people who hated magusis until islam freed them from those magusis and deported them back to their home land  India. 
 It is known that Magusi in semitic is same as Nagusi ( ie dirty person: a person who uses magic by invoking evil spirits by using dirty (Nagis) stuff such as wolf's tail  or putting urine in foood or drink to do favours to women for money (like a woman who wants her husband to love her again or to get pregnant etc). It is well known that the magusis were not from Persia but a low cast from India like gypsies who used to do dirty works for the Persians namely slaughter of animals) that is when they started making future predictions (fortune telling) by studying the signs on the liver of the slaughtered animals. Zoroaster was one of those Magusis who was a great Magician (do magic by dirty stuff) and proclaiming for the first time in history the ideas of Dualism in an official religion. Arabs said in their ancient writings before islam that Zoroaster so disgusted people that they gave him the nick-name Shuraik (ie who adds another god to G-d) since pagans and poly-thiests since ancient times belied that the other gods they worship were not just representations (spirits) of the one mighty god, however Zoroaster was the first to declare a shadow god to the mighty g-d hence God of light and god of darkness to explain the inequality and injustise in the world (remember they were a low cast from india avoided by people (magusis used to live away from villages just like gypsies because they were considered dirty lowly (heathen) posessed by evil spirits they get from the animals they slaughter for the persians). 
 Even the word Magic, Magician, Magi (plural of Magusi in English) come from the magusis of Persia who were not native of Iran but gypsies from India who use Magis=Nagic=Dirty stuff to do their witchcraft and favors to stressed women and men throughout history).even in our times!! 

 Conclusion  Ahura Mazda The name of the Monothiest God in Ancient Persia has nothing to do with dirty Zoroaster prophet of Dualism who appeared circa 700 BC very very late in the history of manking."

 IRWolfie the majority of sources in this article are written by individuals who have made it their mission to attack and debunk Christian Science because of their own personal views of it. Honestly, are you just gullible that you accept these sources, or is it because it serves your desire to make Christian Science look ridiculous to the public? That is an honest question so don't you throw some WP:Faith stuff at me. Swan, Asser, any mainstream fundamentalist Christian sources suggesting that Christian Science is """"heresy"""" etc. - these are all written by vehement opponents to Christian Science, and none of these shed any light on what Christian Science is about. What I would do if I were going to edit this article, is that I would present Christian Science in a historical context using general statements which are objective. I would take all the controversy (which is most of what this article is, starting with the lead piece) and just take all of that and put it in a section called """"controversy"""". If you read encyclopedia Britannica or World Book, they simply state what Christian Science is historically. They don't try to get into it's theology too far by pulling ideas totally out of context, something this Wikipedia article does over and over. A problem I see happening in this article is something that I have seen in conservative Christian literature, which is this: say whatever is necessary to make Christian Science look heretical and outrageous even if it means you have to mislead your reader, because the ends justify the means. So the skeptic physicists are acting just like fundamentalists on here. Nevermind telling the truth about the subject at hand. If we can make it look ridiculous, then we have succeeded. But do those """"scientists"""" ever stop to think that real science is based on truth? Science is when you are trying to get at the truth, to understand reality and the way things really ARE. So tell the truth about the subject in a balanced way, in an intelligent way. Go ahead and put the negative things in, but do it in a way that is not misleading the general public. Stop insulting their intelligence. There is too much good information already out there about Christian Science, for this article to have any credibility in it's present state. It's just a total embarrassment to Wikipedia in my opinion. It makes a joke out of Wikipedia. I would challenge these self proclaimed scientists to put their money where their mouth is, and start with the truth. Not the truth as you see it, or as an antagonist sees it, or as a Christian Scientist sees it, but what about how history sees it? There are basic facts out there about Christian Science. But you won't find very many of them in this article. Again, let's present it objectively, and then later, in appropriate sections, explore the positives and negatives in a fair way. Doesn't anyone want to do this? The trouble I have is that I don't want to have my time wasted if mischief makers are going to keep on doing stupid stuff on this article. I would like to work with some people who really want to get it right. I am not going to write text, source it all, and have someone with a personal agenda come along and reverse my conscientious efforts, and hypocritically cite Wikipedia rules for why I can't place valid content into this article, and even take utter garbage out of it, without someone preaching """"Sources"""" that are no sources at all!"""

 Hello Material Scientist. 
 I would like to let you know that the reason I edited the term """"German Resistance Movement"""" to NAZI (Should have put NASI) meaning Nationalist Socialis Workers Party is because it wasn't all of Germany that was being resisted. They themselves were German.  

 At the same time the cause and actions of such events all come down to Information and propaganda. I am going through similar problems with my own family and catholics. my Initials are JC my mothers name is Mary, fathers name is Emmanuel (The Book of Emanuel AKA the TORA AKA the Bible before translation...

 I seemed to be allowed to do the wrong things as if to accumulate some file against me but any form of organisation and grows was continually destroyed. 

 We had several addresses while I was growing up and I never had the space or time to establish anything in life so I dont really have any companions or friends who can account for anything I have done. 

 I probably need a Wiki Page just for my story but this monsterous network has worked long and hard for me to have any say.

 == This page is ridiculous == 

 First, the Bad Brains back in 1979 were spreading the idea of PMA, Positive Mental Attitude, which significant in two ways, because not only is it the beginning of positive hardcore, but because the Bad Brains practically invented hardcore music, period. It is nearly impossible to overemphasize how influential their message became in the early hardcore punk scene. They inspired bands like Minor Threat and various Better Youth Organizations. 

 As a side note, it is alarming to me that not one reference is made on the Bad Brains page about their philosophy (inspired by Napoleon Hill's """"Think and Grow Rich"""") which was in so many of their songs lyrics (such as """"Attitude"""") 

 Anyway, the article is inaccurate; positive hardcore is not a response to straight edge, which came later. Rather, straight edge was seen as an extension, or subset, of positive minded hardcore.  

 Whatever references claim otherwise are mistaken and uninformed.  """"Positive hardcore"""", unlike straight edge, has no definite boundaries or rules that must apply across the board. Minor Threat (who were straight edge) was as much a positive hardcore band as 7 Seconds and Token Entry (neither of which was ever straight edge) and as much as a band like the Bad Brains (who used marijuana). And while the Bad Brains preached unity and positivity, they were also famously known for the nasty scandal with the Big Boys. So, there's no rules to really outline who """"qualifies"""" or doesn't as positive hardcore. 

 """"Posicore,"""" on the other hand, became a term used beginning around the early to mid 90's to describe bands playing in the """"youth crew"""" style popularized by straight edge bands on Revelation Records or Wishingwell Records and so on. 

 Personally, I think this page is kind of silly and unnecessary if it omits the larger historical backdrop, namely, what was at least originally, the influence and spread of a positive viewpoint espoused by the Bad Brains. There is already pages dedicated to straight edge, under which """"posicore"""" falls as a sub category. There are a plethora of references and books detailing the history of hardcore that could be cited. American Hardcore by Stephen Blush or Dance of Days by Mark Anderson and Mark Jenkins are two well known sources."""

 ==Display limitations== 

 Placing a video scaler before a limited-capability display device will not remove the limitations of that display device. For instance, you can't make a 720p display take a 1080p signal and expect to see all 1920x1080 pixels on the 1280x720 display surface; instead, the display will either scale the signal down or possibly crop the signal. A common misconception of consumers is that if you upscale from a 720p source to 1080p and the TV downscales to 854x480 internally (like within a plasma display), that you would end up with a better image. Since the final display surface does not contain the necessary pixel amount to display the 720p content in its entirety, there is a loss in the vertical and horizontal resolution in the final displayed image. It is preferred to send the display the exact resolution that it needs to output a final display image - even if the output device has more pixels than the source there will have to be blending of pixels or some sort of upscaling and this can cause problems. Some displays may have a further problem when displaying native resolution however; when sent the exact native resolution image, the display may be programmed to assume that it is receiving a signal from a PC (which causes some displays from manufacturers like Pioneer to reduce output brightness to avoid phosphor burn-in from a still image) or to crop off the overscan and zoom the rest.

 Here is a statement from the website of the Sisters. 

 We can certainly now start to build this into the article.   

 Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue 

 """"We are dismayed that a moment of genuine communion during sacred worship is being twisted for political gain by the forces of hatred and dissension. — Sister Edith Myflesh, Current Abbess of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Inc.  

 SAN FRANCISCO — On Sunday the 7th of October, the morning of the Castro Street Fair, two members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence® attended Mass at Most Holy Redeemer Church. Most Holy Redeemer is located in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco and """"prides itself in being an inclusive Catholic community."""" The service was an opportunity to welcome the new Archbishop of San Francisco, Most Rev. George Niederauer. While at Mass the Sisters joined other parishioners in respectful and sincere worship and received Communion from the Archbishop. After the services, they stayed to socialize with the congregation before moving on to attend the Castro Street Fair. 

 Sadly, while the Sisters participated in the celebration, others not there to worship secretly filmed and photographed the Mass hoping to spark a controversy and cast the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and the Archbishop in a negative light. These professional muckrakers then gave the photos to an anti-gay Fundamentalist Catholic Website which in turn sent them to right-wing media outlets who willfully distorted the facts for political gain. 

 The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are appalled that some media outlets have unwittingly spread these distortions while others have intentionally taken advantage to fuel a mean-spirited and divisive political agenda. These forces have been critical of Most Holy Redeemer for their welcoming approach to the diverse community they serve and have frequently seen fit to attack the parishioners as part of a larger campaign against """"San Francisco values."""" 

 Our hearts go out to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and to the Archbishop who have been unfairly stigmatized by these disingenuous campaigns for doing nothing more than following the welcoming teachings of Christ and administering Communion in keeping with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. 

 We would like to take this opportunity to state again that, contrary to the spin of right-wing fanatics, that the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence do not """"mock nuns"""" but live """"as nuns,"""" taking vows that affirm the traditional compassionate and justice-seeking ministries of religious women, extending their reach beyond the convent walls to those most in need. We are open and supportive of all forms of spirituality that teach respect for human life, diversity, freedom and community, including those of the Catholic Church. In fact, we have given several thousand dollars in grants to several religious-based organizations, including Most Holy Redeemer. 

 It is no secret that our vows sometimes call us to challenge the dogmas and hypocrisies of the Catholic hierarchy, in the same way they call us to confront politicians and even leaders within the queer community whenever they use their power and influence to promote fear, shame, division, and self-hatred. It is a bittersweet irony that these same forces of fear and shame now use the media to twist a moment of genuine communion into another justification for policies that harm people of faith and members of the LGBTQ community. 

 In keeping with our vows to expiate stigmatic guilt and promulgate universal joy, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence call on all people of good faith to oppose those who would desecrate the sanctity of a church and defile a moment of true communion for cheap political gain. In a world wracked by violence and fear, we have no time for such lies and will continue to serve our community by boldly proclaiming that joy is more powerful than shame. 

 We extend our sincerest gratitude and affection to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and hope that their new Archbishop continues to walk with them in service to the gospel of joy and justice.""""http://www.thesisters.org/MHR_Release.html"""

A retail site selling a toy train provides product information details about the toy because people don't buy products without information on them, but they are selling the toy train, not the information.

 == Final draft… maybe == 
 This will go on the evolutionary ethics page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics, it will go after the section called """"Further reading""""  

 Evolutionary ethics struggles as a system of normative ethics, which asks the question """"what should I do?"""" It struggles due to the logical fallacy of turning a statement about what is, into one about what we ought to do (see naturalistic fallacy). As a meta-ethical theory, one that tells us the nature of moral judgments, evolutionary ethics can be used as a decent descriptor on why we have certain views on right and wrong. As a meta-ethical claim it does not tell us what is right and wrong, but rather that the origin of our ethical practices come from our evolutionary history. This tends to lead to a less black and white view on ethical beliefs and leaves much more room for gray areas.   

 Many philosophers who support this view of evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine Aristotelian teleology, a belief that we can't reduce things to the parts that compose them, but the end they are trying to achieve is very important. At times evolutionary ethics is used to undermine moral realism, a view that morals are objectively true and do not rely upon a person’s thoughts or attitudes. However other philosophers still use evolution to champion moral realism. Often they will argue that there is a set of moral truths and that our behavior naturally tend towards moral truths because of evolution. 

 More often however, it is used to support moral subjectivism. This is a belief that moral truths are subjective and often times based on cultural norms, thoughts, and attitudes towards a subject matter rather than a set of mind-independent truths. Evolutionary ethics assumes we have a set of basic underlying morals, such as not killing another person. This stems from the evolutionary need to allow the species to survive. Then some of the more graininess of ethics comes from the differences in cultural upbringings and backgrounds, and thus the finer points of ethics would be considered subjective.

 I don't give a f**k  
 They done push me to the limit the more I live  
 I might blow up any minute, did it again  
 Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon  
 While this cops bragging about the ni**a he's jackin  
 I see no justice  
 All I see is ni**as dying fast  
 The sound of a gun blast  
 Then watch the hurst past  
 Just another day in the life G  
 Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snippe me  
 The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man  
 But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man  

 I went to the bank to cash my cheque  
 I get more respect from the muthaf**kin dope man  
 The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes  
 They got dough but they hate us though  
 You better keep your mind on the real s**t  

 And f**k trying to get with these crooked a*s hypocrites  
 They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down  
 Just can't understand why we getting respect now  
 Mama told me they're be days like this  
 But I'm pissed cause it stays like this  
 And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait  
 Gimme a break  
 How much s**t can a ni**a take  
 I ain't goin' nowhere no how  
 What you wanna throw down  
 Better bring your guns pal  
 Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay  
 f**k bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K  
 And even if they shoot me down  
 There'll be another ni**a bigger  
 from the mutha-f**kin' underground  

 So step but you better step quick  
 Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bulls**t  
 You're watching the makings of a physco-path  
 The truth didn't last  
 Before the wrath and aftermath  
 Who's that behind the trigger?  
 Who'd do yah figure!?  
 A mutha-f**kin night ni**a  
 Ready to buck and rip s**t up  
 I had enough and I don't give a f**k  

 ni**as!, isn't just the blacks  
 also a gang of mutha-f**kas dressed in blue slacks  
 They say ni**as hang in packs and their attitude is s**tty  
 Tell me, who's the biggest gang of ni**as in the city  
 They say ni**as like to do ni**as  
 Throw me in the cuffs with just two ni**as  
 A street walkin' ni**a and a beat walkin' ni**a with a badge  
 I had to shoot yah and the pa*s for the blast take his cash  
 And bash his head in dump him at the dead in  
 And that's just his luck  
 Cause a ni**a like me  
 don't really give a f**k  

 Walked in the store what's everybody staring at  
 They act like they never seen a muthaf**ker wearing black  
 Following a ni**a and s**t  
 Ain't this a bi**h  
 All I wanted was some chips  
 I wanna take my business else where  
 But where?  
 Cause who in the hell cares  
 About a black man with a black need  
 They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend  
 I wonder if knows that my income is more than  
 His pension, salary and then some  
 Your daughter is my number one fan  
 And your trife a*s wife wants a life with a black man  
 So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack  
 Sit back and get fat off the fat cat  
 while he thinks that he's getting over  
 I bust a move as smooth as casanova  
 And count another quick meal  
 I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real  
 And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme  
 AS strong as a f**kin' nine  
 Mail stacked up ni**as wanna act up  
 Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up  
 But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot  
 Usta come but he's done, now we run the block  
 To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up  
 They know we fed up  
 But we they just don't give a f**k

 I suppose that firing an entire artillery battery of those standard warning template's isn't the most constructive thing to do. I am not entirely sure what the issue is with this page, but there are two issues here: 
 * If a page is tagged with an AFD (Article's for deletion) template, that template should stay on the page until resolved. Currently the page is still up for discussion, so the template must stay on it. 
 * Blanking a page is not a means of deletion, since the page will remain around (Deleting all page contents is considered vandalism, unless there is a clear reason to remove the content. Think copyright violations or BLP Violations for that). 

 I... assume you disagree with the deletion template and eventually simply blanked the page in protest? If this is the case i cannot offer to much advice: Waiting for the AFD to resolve is the only method to deal with this. If i'm minintrepreting the situation, or if there is a serious problem with the page that would require it to be blanked, just leave me a message on my talk page and i'll have a look (If not today, when i am around again).  , """

 ==Advice== 
 Hi. These discussions are easier to follow if they are in chronological order, so I have moved your two comments down. If you want to contest the deletion of your article the first thing to do is to ask one of the admins who deleted it, by leaving a message on their talk page - you can see who they are by clicking on the red-linked article title. But first, you should read this advice: 

 Repeating what I wrote under Copyright release"""" above: it is not enough to assert that you have permission to use the material, for two reasons: 
 *to publish material in Wikipedia involves much more than just permission to reproduce. As it says at the bottom of every edit screen: """"You irrevocably agree to release your contributions under the  CC-BY-SA 3.0 License and the GFDL"""" which implies permission to anyone to re-copy, edit, and use for any purpose. It is important that the copyright holder understands this. More information at WP:Copyrights#Contributors' rights and obligations. 
 *while I do not doubt that you are who you say, Wikipedia has no way to be sure of that: you are just someone on the end of an internet connection. Copyright issues can give us severe problems, so if you want to submit copyright material you must follow the steps explained in the notice above headed """"Copyright problems with Rosina Bierbaum"""". 

 Two more important points: 
 *Wikipedia is not a sort of notice-board on which you can simply pin extracts from your web-site: it is an encyclopedia, with its own standards for articles. One important way in which it differs from a notice-board or forum is that an article is not owned by its author, or by any editor - see WP:Ownership of articles. Another warning on every edit screen is """"If you do not want your writing to be edited, used, and redistributed at will, then do not submit it here."""" You must expect that your contribution will be edited, and you will not be able to control it. 
 *Also, since you work for Dr Bierbaum's school, you have from Wikipedia's point of view a conflict of interest in writing about her. That does not bar your contribution, but it means that it is likely to get more scrutiny than if you were an impartial editor. There is advice on editing with a conflict of interest at WP:BESTCOI and at . 

 After all that, my advice: if you don't want to write from scratch, follow the steps above to organise a copyright release. Trim the text of peacock terms like """"prestigious"""" - from memory, it was not too bad in that respect. Add enough independent references to establish that Dr Bierbaum is notable to the standard described in Notability (academics); I don't think that should be a problem. Trim down to essentials rather than include too much detail. Do not list every paper that she has ever written - for that sort of detail you should link to her website. Look at some of the articles listed in Wikipedia:Good articles#Educators for models, though you do not need initially to be as richly-referenced as they are.  Disclose on the article's talk page that you have a COI in that you work for Dr Bierbaum's school. If you like, prepare a draft in a user sub-page - click on the red-link , type in the box and save it. 

 I'm afraid you probably approached Wikipedia thinking that your task was no more than to pin on a notice-board an extract from your website, and are by now dismayed to find that it is more complicated than that. The reason is that Wikipedia only remains a useful encyclopedia, rather than a sort of glorified Myspace, by having standards and trying to enforce them. If you have any questions, ask them below - I will watch this talk page. Regards,   """

But before we start entering into conspiracy theories, we need to understand the mentality of the British at the end of the war. A lot of the British National Archives were gutted and some valuable documents were lost, either through carelessness, or because some bureaucrat in White Hall didn't see the need in keeping them or they took up too much space. The papers of Trafford Leigh-Mallory is a prime example; which is a shame because his approach to air operations is misunderstood and his papers would have served researchers well. So they had form for this kind of thing and I wouldn't regard it as 'hyper-unusual'.

 == Please resist the urge to spin == 

 As a gay gamer who has been playing video games since the 1976 Fairchild, I can say that I have been FAR from impressed with the representation of gay identity in video gaming. I can tolerate ridiculous stereotypical depictions of gay folk, but what is worse is the systematic censorship. Classifying mere gay identity as """"mature/sexual/adult"""" is one way of enabling retailers like Wal-Mart to de-gay their shelves and content creators to de-gay their products, citing sales concerns. It is patently discriminatory to act as if being openly gay is """"more sexual"""" than being openly hetero, yet people blithely accept this double-standard all the time. 

 While there isn't much news coverage to be found about this, the Christian Right is driving quite a bit of this. Their scare tactics routinely include trying to convince parents that gays are after their children. Having openly gay characters in video games, especially when they're not villains and fools, is a threat to their system of using us as pawns in their quest for power. 

 The Sims proved people wrong who declared """"only hetero males play video games"""". Besides, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to make products designed to appeal to the taste of one demographic and proclaim that others simply have no interest in gaming in the first place. It's quite convenient. How much of this dearth of gay content (and I don't mean token content) is due to the fact that most developers are heterosexual men? 

 So, please resist the urge to spin the history of gays-in-gaming as being much rosier than it is. Even The Sims titles censor us, making us """"convert"""" people into homosexuals (a very offensive thing to force a gay person to do, let me tell you) and force characters into romantic interactions. A token non-foolish non-evil gay character here and there does not equate to an industry in which people like myself truly feel there are products that are non-narrow. And, frankly, the phrase """"the pink dollar"""" itself is rather offensive. The money I earn is green. When I touch it it doesn't transform due to """"the gay"""". Historically-minded folks may also want to remember that pink was the color for boys and blue was the color for girls in the 19th century. I would hope that developers will start seeing an end to heterosexism and homophobia as being more about creative freedom than cash."""

All we need to inform the reader is that more of Cartman's toys are being destroyed. We do not need to emphasize specific details about the mutilations. This is why the previous summary is more streamlined. Second, you mention Rumper Tumpskin and Muscle Man Marc, without explain who or what they are. Given the number of varied non-human and fantasy characters that appear in the series, you can't assume that readers know who these people are. This is another reason why just saying, """"Despite being at Token's house, Cartman discovers Muscle Man Marc and Rumper Tumpskin, two more of his toys, destroyed, with the remaining one, a doll named Polly Prissypants, sitting in an armchair with a revolver, claiming responsibility for all the toy 'murders'."""" is simpler and better. It explains to the reader what is happening in a direct, and to-the-point manner. 
 Thanks.   """

 Transferred from my talk page    

 Given your extensive work in historical items, it is surprising that you would want to eliminate (reduce to a redirect) the Anaheim (train station) article. There is much historical information associated with that train station that would not be appropriate to include in the article for the new Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center. (For example, the history of service by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railwaywhile the ATSF did not serve that current building, it did serve that station.) Please do not eliminate this article. However, maintaining them as separate articles will necessitate some duplicate information, but it should be kept to a minimum.

 == Taxobox removal == 

 I removed the taxobox. The article seems to be about a common name that refers to most (or all) species of two cetacean families.   

 :This was reverted here, with the edit summary Revert - information in infobox takes this into account, provides useful information. Dolphin is a common name for some species of the two families, not a single scientific taxon. The article explains this fact, I would not remove """"useful information"""". The specious inclusion is very misleading, it is best explained in the article. What reliable source would state it refers to these two taxa, when some of them have the common name of whale? Why should the taxobox be used for an article about a non systematic name?   

 ::I wouldn't  have a problem with having two families in the taxobox, except that under current taxonomy this one is now incorrect.  I am not concerned about the fact that some dolphins have a common name of """"whale"""", since most authoritative sources would recognize those species dolphin species despite the common name, since all are in Delphinidae.  But the problem is that the River Dolphins have now been split into multiple families, so just using """"Delphinidae and Platanistoidea"""" is no longer correct.  And rather than include five families in the taxobox, which becomes somewhat spurious, it seems better to remove the taxobox and discuss the taxonomy in the article.    

 :::What if the family section is just left out? Or be given a note like """"See article""""? I like the infobox and it does provide useful data and a basic glance at where dolphins fit in in the animal kingdom (it never fails to amaze me how many people do not seem to realise dolphins are mammals!). Looking at some other articles, there's no consensus on the infobox usage. The whale article has no infobox for example, while many others such as the shark, lizard or turtle articles do have them.    

 ::I have a problem with original research being used in our document. This would include basing a taxon on a common name, there is no concordance between common names and biological nomenclature. A reader comes here to acquire facts, those few who do not know they are mammals can gain that information from the content proper of the article. The two families, or even five, are not given an accepted taxon; the fact that some reliable sources (also!) name some of the species as Dolphins is incidental, not authoritative. Everyone likes the taxobox, let us be careful with our names here most of all, it is not an infobox. I appreciate that the undue weight given to other names appended to the correct name may cause this misapprehension, but the consensus is that a taxobox should summarise a single taxon and be included in only one article. Whale is without one for reasons that are intimately linked with this article's title. The other examples you have given are [hopefully] given in RS that state, unequivocally, a common name refers to a taxon: """"Sharks (superorder Selachimorpha)""""; """"Lizards (Suborder: Lacertilia) are a very large and widespread group of reptiles of the order Squamata"""" [highly debatable, but still a single taxon]; and superorder Chelonia (turtles) is yet another reptilian (Sauropsida) example that needed resolving. Removing duplicated or specious (spurious) taxoboxes is never popular with those who had a notion to include them, I'm not sure why, but it is certain to be the right path for clarifying explanations to our dear readers. An article on the common name 'dolphin' is justified, it could be more than a dab, but it is not a taxon. Please undo the unfounded revert of my edit.   

 :::All dolphins belong to the suborder of Odontoceti, every animal mentioned in this article does, so the taxobox """"tree"""" is correct (especially considering my last edit) - so no incorrect data is given in the box. I don't feel the definition of a dolphin as used in this article is based on original research, but is what is quite commonly accepted as what animals are covered under the word dolphin.

 ==Section on Buddhism== 

 I would take issue with the comment """"Fasting is not practiced by lay Buddhists because it is seen as a deviation from the Middle Path."""" This is a sweeping generalization and seems like mere conjecture on the author's part. It also suggest that monks and nuns, who do not eat after mid-day, are deviating from the Middle Path, although it is stated earlier of this practice that """"This is not considered a fast but rather a disciplined regimen aiding in meditation and good health."""" The Buddha did not recommend that any of his followers deviate from the Middle Path, as this Middle Path is at the very core of all he taught.  There are practices traditionally undertaken by monks and nuns which might strike us today as excessively austere, but the kind of asceticism undertaken by the Buddha, which he later realized as contrary to the Middle Way, consisted of such things as holding his arm in the air for weeks on end, eating only a single grain of rice per day for a very long time, eating his own excrement, and so forth. I do not think that the austerities undertaken by the ordained Sangha should be confused with those practices. 

 Also, I take issue with the section which reads """"Chenrezig taught her the method of Nyung Ne[15] in which one keeps the eight precepts on the first day, then refrains from both food and water on the second. Although seemingly against the Middle Way, this practice is to experience the negative karma of both oneself and all other sentient beings and, as such is seen to be of benefit. Other self-inflicted harm is discouraged.""""  Taking the eight precepts for one day and then abstaining from food and water for another day is """"self-inflicted harm""""?  I don't think so; the author's own biases appear to be influencing this interpretation.  I also object to the suggestion that the purpose of this practice is to experience """"the negative karma of both oneself and all other sentient beings"""".  I am sure that this is one way of viewing the practice, but I am not sure that it is the most correct in terms of Buddhist doctrine."""

 I do not think I need to mention it but behind these """"various IPs"""" there are more than one user instead of a single one. It would be impossible for one to handle all your alleged crap. I don't think I need to mention it because it's totally irrelevant how many people oppose something. It does NOT count how many are on which side, it counts what is behind: arguments and truth. With your lies and will to mislead people by depicting the game as something it is not, you're runnining against a wall of truth and arguments and I'll make sure you won't tear that wall down, no matter if you're a biased AA players or a biased admin on the site. I'm right, and you know that very well. And even if you are in the majority, this rule remains true: """"Something is still right, even if everyone thinks it's not. Something is wrong even if everyone thinks it's right."""" You don't EVEN think you're right, you just pretend! Knock off your pathetic pretence for I only accept the truth, and the truth only. I don't mind if your ludicrous opposition is kept up for years, it will end up without success and the feeling of having wasted your time with your hypocricy.  

 Saying the game is primarily propaganda, I'll have the truth backing me. Equating it with advertisement and even pretending as if """"many players disagree(d) over which label fit(ted) better"""", you back it with lies. As if anyone in the game knew anything! Search the official forum for the word """"propaganda"""", you'll find nothing. """"Many""""? What a liar you are. You represent not """"many"""" players, you'll represent ONE. And you disagree just for the sake of disagreeing. 

 If you're actually interesting in finding the truth, you'd have read the articles with an open mind and agreed on that. Actually I don't need to do this because it's not the truth you're seeking, but I've found another university page and would like to post it. http://www.minitrue.nl/essays/nmnc-aa/justin.html 
 You didn't manage to read the talk page, so I'll summarize the most importent statements concerning our which-fits-better-topic. 

 """"In this contribution I will also distinguish the advergame from the propagame in order to give a further analysis of America's Army."""" 

 """"The game America's Army, the propagame as I will call it, is unique in its being."""" 

 """" From advergame to propagame """" 

 """"The message America's Army sends itself is propagandistic. It propagandises a certain kind of lifestyle message in which the army would like the participant to join and become. Propaganda itself has a history within religion. Religion also sends the same message, to let the participant (or the participant in becoming) join and become the religion (so sending the message of religion). So America's Army, with its governmental background, is instead of an advergame, better to be described as a propagame."""" 

 BETTER TO BE DESCRIBED AS A PROPAGAME. What did I say? PRIMARILY fits the definition of propaganda. =>Authority argument (university) underscores my version. 

 """"When it comes to the propagame America's Army, the next quotation is striking: 
 """"The initial success of America's Army has exceeded the Army's expectations, and Colonel Wardynski and his design team are excited about the possibilities. """"We're going to be pushing out new versions of the game as fast as we can build them,"""" he says. """"This same team will be building missions, weapons, and new features for years to come."""" The nation's youth can expect a lot more from their friendly army of one.""""( 'America's Army' Targets Youth by Jacob Hodes & Emma Ruby Sachs)"""" 

 """" From the analysis of the advergame and the striking resemblance I have described with the propagame America's Army I will now turn my attention to the consequences for communication on Internet by such games."""" 

 """" The exception is America's Army because it communicates itself as a company in which citizens can join. The aim is to let the gamers themselves join the company as an employee and be the producers within of the message the army sends. One of the aims of advergames is to construct a process of viral marketing, but this is done unlike the propagame. The advergame aims that consumers virally communicate about the game or the message it beholds for the purpose of spreading the word, but not to become one with the company itself. DaimlerChrysler for example wouldn't make a game in which one is being trained to become the director of a car factory (this would create competition). Not yet (emphasised), but maybe in the future it will when one seeks for employees."""" 

 """"I thus called it a propagame: a game that propagandises a message to become the message. Within the game, gamers are disciplined and the power structures are like the common army power structure: top down hierarchical.""""

"050478638702d299","== Mediterranean-Type Ecosystems == 

 I have created a redirect from 'Mediterranean-Type Ecosystems'. But I am pre-empting a discussion on this subject.   

 'Mediterranean-Type Ecosystems' is a generic name for a biome which is used by ecologists and conservation managers. It could be used, for instance, to refer to historic or future, as well as modern, distributions of the biome. It is quite a clunky expression, and often shortened to 'MTE's' 

 In contrast, 'Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub' is the name for the current distribution of the biome as defined by wwf (here I'll say 'Mfws'). It is a horribly clunky expression and I have never seen it written, and doubt if it is ever heard spoken, outside of WWF's biome project. 

 'Mfws' cannot be used to generalise about features of the biome - eg to discuss the extent that parts of south eastern Australia might have MTE-type (careful!) attributes (where forests, woodlands and scrub communities dominate which are fire-prone, experience predicable summer droughts, and share many traits, ecosystems and taxa with Mfws of South or south west Australia). Similarly, the 'California chaparral and woodlands' has many ecosystems which do not fit well with the MTE concept. I am not here making an argument that we should include or exclude these ecoystems from the biome: WWF has done great work defining ecoregios and biomes as they have, we all recognise that environmental heterogeneity makes the task complex, boundaries have to go somewhere, and we have solid precedents with strict definitions to work with (eg Koppen), and it is all subjective anyway. All I am saying is that 'Mfws' is about the biome that exists at the present as defined cartographically by WWF, whereas MTEs are about generalising the ecology and behaviour of the ecosystem represented; perhaps there is place for both.  
 I can see Mfws nesting within MTE, but not the other way around. 

 I propose an introductory paragraph (much shorter than this) describing the relationship between 'Mediterranean Basin', MTE, Mfws and 'Mediterranean Climate'. But perhaps there is merit in an MTE page?"

You have often made the distinction between it (a preference) and child molestation (the act). So are you saying that a person cannot be primarily sexualy interested in adults and prepubescent children? If so, this article is not saying that either. Or are you saying that the """"exclusive"""" part is not needed, because """"primary"""" takes care of it?

I don't always relate the """"non-exclusive"""" offender to a """"primary"""" offender, though it can mean that. I take """"primary"""" to mean a pedophile who often sexually focuses on prepubescent children and can get a little sexually aroused by pubescents or post-pubescents.

 No one at Columbine was armed; except of course the two boys. Since they had a monopoly of firepower they could walk around killing whomever they wanted. Now, if the teachers and/or security guards had been allowed to be armed that probably would have been enough of a detterence to the two boys. Even if they still had tried it, it is doubtful as many people would have been killed and wounded.  

 This alternative is not completely hypothetical either. A few years ago at the Appalachian School of Law, a student came to school with a gun. He shot the dean, a professor, and another student. He was then subdued by three classmates that had run to their cars to get their own guns. A Columbine-like tragedy had been avoided.

 Good! I am glad this is going to discussion, as I think it should, regardless of whether the outcome is in favor of the ggmania or gamespot link. I do believe that there are enough references to gamespot in the article, and that another one is not needed. I have not received ANY MESSAGE from google saying that gameguru mania is a """"dangerous site"""" in anyway, as you seem to think. The key ideas here, in my opinion, are this:  

 *1) My browser does not display that the site has any offending 'malware' or anything of such.  
 *2) Even if there is a problem, which I do not think there is, that is irrelevant to wikipedia. Wikipedia does not get dictated by what google says or does not say.  

 That's my take on the situation. But, as I'll say again, I believe that User:Dachannien has acted in the best interests of everyone in bringing this to discussion, and I totally support his actions in this regard.  """

 :The ideal ratio is zero - that is, zero first-party references, at least for things that relate to claims of notability.  For academics, it's not always going to happen, but get as close as you can, even if it means greatly reducing the scope and size of the article.  Basically, barring """"gotta have it"""" things like year of birth and year of death, if it's not important enough that someone else has written about it, then it's not important enough to put in Wikipedia.  The article on Nobel-prizewinning immunologist Rolf M.

 This site is racist, rude, and just flat-out offensive. I have never before seen such a hateful, vulgar and slanderous excuse for a website in all my life. Ok, so it is meant to be a satirical 
 take on wikipedia, obviously due to its long lecturing paragraphs on innocuos objects like a condom or a pencil. But this website is an abomination to all of mankind, and 
 nothing other than a hateful, trolling, repulsive, sickening iniquity den of lies, graphic gore, and racism. It claims to be """"satirical"""". It is time we got one thing straight. 
 Satire can be a take on other peoples' beliefs, religion and race, and sometimes it can go too far. But the bottom line is, satirical comedy is meant to be FUNNY. And, let's be frank, 
 this is NOT FUNNY AT ALL! I have never laughed once at any of the articles about Britain, America, and most particularly; the articles about jewish people, which made me want to vomit. 
 Incidentially, it seems that the creator, whoever scum he might be, has a personal vendetta among Jewish people. For example, there is picture on the article about Jewish people which 
 shows a Jewish man eating what seems to be a dead baby, with the caption """"Jews eat babies"""". There is also a page about Adolf Hitler, with these made-up facts, and Positive comments 
 which makes him seem quite nice, and I'm sure I don't need a second opinion on considering that this is just bullshit. 
 This site takes the piss out of dead people, men in wheelchairs, and reoccurs racial slurs, like """"nigger, paki, kike"""", and many more nasty words. 
 Whoever this spam faced hate-mongerer is, I hope he hangs himself soon, or as these pigs say: """"self-pwn"""", quickly before some very offended """"kikes"""" find out where 
 he lives, and slit his throat with their fingernails, and post a picture of in on the site, with a caption that says """" We have taken GirlVinyl's throat, and here it is. Now we go on 
 to take over the site - The Jews""""

  Hello, this is a post to tell everyone what is really going on, I posted previously about mono-directional mass displacement (E=MC2), well here it is, ill try to explain as simple as I can, first I need to explain what this “engine” does, answer = it is a “space engine” which allows users to move forward in one direction using nothing but electricity in the vacuum of space, now to explain how it works, just ask yourself if you ever looked a spinning record (LP), or a centerfuse, and realized that the energy on the outer circumference of the LP or centerfuse is greater than the center as the object spins, and the faster it spins the more energy is created, now imagine you have a magnetic object attached to the outer circumference, and you are able to release it (easiest way it to use EM throughout construction) as the object is “flung” in a set curve, now imagine you made 2 spinning “records” in opposite directions, this is to counter the torque, only, as you “fling” these magnetic, Lets call them ball bearings, simplest, but other things can be used, but remember in order to balance properly, EM must be employed throughout the machine, so something magnetic must be used, the more ball bearings released the greater the forward energy created, this is done my simply slowing down the cascading bombardment of “ball bearings” using EM due to the high level of friction created, and if you want a “space engine” that’s not going to strand you in space, friction is going to be your main problem along with balance. 

 I came up with this when I was 7 years old, and because of my understanding of mechanical engineering, I was employed by the US government to help them reverse engineer the engine from the wreckage from the 1940’s “weather balloon” that uses this engine. 

 The outer skin is carbon fiber nano tubes, with an aluminum oxide coating, “diamond sheet”, I do not think I need to explain much further, pretty simple to understand, but if any of you guys have any questions, please post them, ill try to explain the best I can 

 Also look at like a balloon because that is essentially what it is, its light weight, and filled with hydrogen, just like a birthday balloon!!!     
 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 below is """"black out"""" top secret, the government knew about this long ago, but Americans are the butt monkey of the world, the jew fuck einstein said it very cryptic by calling it E=MC2, but it is an efficient """"space engine"""" which would allow NON jews to become the so called gods that the jews have been, and is an inside joke because of the crude oil (gasoline) makes it impossible to think, so the jews are already winning by KILLING Americans by forcing them to in hail large amounts of gasoline fumes, this over time leaves you weak and vulnerable to the jews slave labor credit 

 if you guys are about the RIGHT CHANGE, you need to inform all your followers of this, but if you slide this under the table, me and many other super geniuses will declare you as also an enemy as the jews are, and when the time comes, you too will fail, but if you are about empowering geniuses, act now, procrastination will lead to both of your down fall, show us what you stand for, if you are about reaching for the stars, then below is how its done

It was a mammoth show, involving eight floats, built on buses, with various Germanic features - including outsized Playmobil figures, the moon (to represent Germany pioneering rocket scientists,  e.g. Wernher von Braun), and figures from ancient Germanic mythology, including thunder god Thor. Artistic director Paulo Barros, who has already choreographed two winning Sambadrome performances, packed Germany into five acts, beginning with Germanic gods and assorted mythic creatures. There follows Goethe's Faust, Bertolt Brecht's outcast characters, Fritz Lang robots, and a depiction of Marlene Dietrich as the Blue Angel. Meanwhile, the """"Universe of Children"""" section is dedicated to German fairytales and toys.

 No explanation was given for removing the two sentences altogether that I added about Liquid ASS, which are as follows: 

 Another stink prank product, Liquid ASS , comes in a small bottle and is applied to objects with a fine stream by squeezing the bottle.  Since Liquid ASS does not use sulfur, it has a genuine smell of feces and road-kill. 

 I also find it interesting that the method of applying Liquid ASS is the same as that as used by Who Me.  Does Liquid ASS smell as bad, also (or worse)?  Sounds like a good assignment for the administrator since this topic apparently falls within his area of expertise.

Apparently this is not the context that was desired, so what exactly is meant by the criticism that the Palmer quote is """"out of context""""? 
 :* I don't see why the Palmer quote is """"gratuitous"""". It provides motivation for chiropractic's early strong opposition to vaccination. We can't expect the casual reader to be familiar with this motivation. 
 :* I was originally opposed to putting the Kansas data in on the grounds that it wasn't published in a refereed journal, but Fyslee liked it on the grounds that it is a reliable source. Fyslee talked me into it so I put it in. I disagree that the Kansas data is """"cherry-picking""""; it's the most recent survey we have and its results are not hugely different from other surveys. However, it does appear to be two editors to one right now, so for now I removed it. We can revisit this issue if Fyslee chimes in again. 
 :* While it's true that statistics can be manipulated, these statistics (except for the Kansas data) are taken from reliable reviews, not from primary sources. When reliable reviews are reporting numbers, I don't see why the Wikipedia article should settle for vaguer statements. 
 :* As mentioned above the article could use reorganization, but that's a big project; for now many chiropractors do argue against the effectiveness of vaccines (unlike most other skeptics, who focus on safety) so this is the most plausible location for the material now.

It's conclusions will not be valid due to confounding differences and the rarity of white lions 
 In other words there is no statistical validity in a statement that a white lion pride has hunting success versus a tawny pride because the hunting behavior is complex and learned. the only way to compare hunting success without studying tens (Or hundreds) of prides would be to study several white prides and several tawny ones for baseline and then color the individuals, and see if a difference exists. At best it could be stated that the hunting success of the pride(s) cannot be differentiated from the tawny lions based on the anecdotal evidence available. given their rarity it would not be likely that evidence of predation on white cubs could be found. It is more likely that the coloration of adaults is not beneficial to hunting success depending on the coloring of the surround I'm not a big cat expert or know much about timbavati or SA. within the references there is information that implies that the whites are differentially outcasted.

 == What is and isn't a tribe? == 

 I think this article needs to better describe what a tribe actually means, and in particular what sorts of groups or societies are or are not tribes.  It also needs to better explain what the objections to using the word """"tribe"""" are.  I have a dictionary that defines the word tribe, but gives a caveat on the usage that:  
 :''In historical contexts the word tribe is broadly accepted ( ‘the area was inhabited by Slavic tribes’), but in contemporary contexts it is problematic when used to refer to a community living within a traditional society. It is strongly associated with past attitudes of white colonialists towards so-called primitive or uncivilized peoples living in remote undeveloped places. For this reason it is generally preferable to use alternative terms such as community or people. 
 However, I've also seen people object to the use of """"tribe"""" do describe such ancient societies, claiming """"they weren't tribes, they were kingdoms"""" (this was in reference to Germanic rather than Slavic tribes I think - I don't know if that makes any difference).  In summary, I'm unclear of the meaning of the word if """"tribe"""", and the objections to it are because: 
 :a) It is a meaningful word, but not considered """"politically correct"""" due to association with colonialist attitudes 
 :b) It is a meaningful word, but often gets misused to describe things that are not tribes 
 :c) It has no consistent meaning, and doesn't tell you anything useful about groups so described

 The well-intended additions over the past 12 months have unfortunately rendered the article too long and lacking structure. In addition, there are still quite important omissions in the text. 
 My view is that a few improvements are needed to restore the article to B+ status. 
 * The Introduction comes too close to the formal definition, leading to undue repetition of material 
 * The examples in the introduction are too detailed: the verification of the axioms (which should come after the Formal Definition anyway) burdens the text too much 
 * The choice of examples in the introduction could be improved:  
 ** Being real-valued is irrelevant in the first example 
 ** The most common function sheaves from geometry (esp. smooth functions, holomorphic functions) should make an early appearance 
 ** Presheaves that fail to be sheaves should make an appearance early (bounded functions is a good choice) 
 ** The example on solutions of diff equations may be too specialised here (should be shorter / later if included). 
 ** Should include the sheaf of sections ofany vector bundle, not just the tangent bundle (vector fields). This is indeed the motivating example for sheaves! 
 * The detailed example of the constant sheaf on a two-point space is way too detailed. It uses an enormous amount of space for what is a tedious but entirely straightforward exercise. And the example itself is too trivial for treatment in an encyclopaedia article. 
 * Sheaves of abelian groups require an own section, with exact sequences discussed briefly and a pointer to Abelian categories 
 * Sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings need some space; good place to mention that vector bundle = locally free sheaf (over whatever structure sheaf of ones geometric structures) - further discussion belongs elsewhere 
 * The section on sheaf cohomology is of appropriate length (short) but not balanced: while injective resolutions do not lead to manageable computations, by far the most common way of computing cohomology groups besides the Čech method is using other acyclic resolutions (de Rham cohomology, Dolbeault cohomology, singular cohomology!). Pointing instead to Borel-Bott-Weil theorem is out of place here."

 :::::I still disagree with leaving the sentence as is. I have no issue with leaving the """"Austrian/Ron Paul type"""" label that Krugman uses to criticize Schiff, but Krugman is making a generalization here that leaves the reader no other interpretation than to accept Krugman's premise and conclusion. Because A, ergo B. If we use just the label """"economist"""" for Krugman and do not identify the branch of theory that he identifies with, it would give undue weight to his criticism of Schiff and his Austrian economic leanings because the lead for the Schiff article does not describe Schiff as a trained economist whereas Krugman is a professional economist writer. So to use the earlier analogy, if Krugman's view of the Austrian school can be boiled down to Because A, ergo B, then Austrians may view the Krugman premise as Because A, ergo C. In otherwords, Krugman says Austrians are wrong and Austrians view their position as correct. Hence, if we accept the disparaging context of Krugman's label and reproduce it verbatim in the Schiff article, it must be prefaced giving context to Krugman's self described leanings. To allay 's concern that Krugman does not consider himself a Keynesian, I performed a google search for """"krugman keynesian"""" and looking at several of the top five results would strongly imply that Krugman holds a Keynesian worldview. Here a couple that I was able to glean: I April 25, 2012 - The Big Wrong - """"And now the results are in: Keynesians have been completely right, Austerians utterly wrong — at vast human cost.""""  II April 25, 2012 - WHY AREN’T WE ALL KEYNESIANS YET? - """" I have often wondered why Keynes - unlike, say, Freud - has never become a pop cultural icon."""" I will reiterate this point again; since the Schiff article identifies John Maynard Keynes as an opponent of Schiff's, and since Krugman seems to identify with Keynes, ergo prefacing Krugman's criticism of Schiff and all the """"Austrian/Ron Paul types"""" by using the label """"Keynesian economist"""" is both descriptive and balanced. I see no evidence in wikipedia or wikitionary to show keynesian as a generally accepted derisive term; I can see that it may be derisive among those who hold an opposing economic view either as an adherrent to an opposing school or informally by not accepting Keynesian implications on government policies.

 OPPOSE  This Item should not be included.  No elected officials or representatives from these cities made this decision.  Criminals who have intimidated and tortured unarmed civilians have announced to fake elections on Sunday.  They recieve their marching orders from Putin. 

 (3) Daily reports over the last month in NYTimes and London Times of armed military conflict between pro-Russian and Ukrainian para-military groups in the Slovyansk and Holivka corridor (150km circumference) to the immediate west of Luhansk. 

 OPPOSE  It is the """"armed conflict between Putin supported para-military groups and Ukranian civilians and military in Eastern Ukraine."""" 

 London Times is currently owned by Rupert Murdoch, a man known for making up more stuff than the editors of this wikipedia article. 

 (4) Putin announcement to abide by 2014 Geneva Pact and offer/pledge to de-escalate the Russian military build-up on the Ukraine border from early MAY. 

 OPPOSE You do not post this announcement unless you also post that Putin is a pathological liar and never abides by his or Russia's promises. 

 (5) John Kerry 4-point plan of US State department to Renormalize Russia's relation to Crimea and Ukraine. 

 You could, not that the 4-point plan means anything.  Why not post Kerry's recipe for biscuits as well? 

 (6) Issue of economic insolvency of Ukraine (bankruptcy) in EU reports on economic viability of Ukraine to support Crimea. 

 OPPOSE You should post that the country had most of its wealth stolen by Putin supporters. 

 (7) Massive Russian investment in Crimea to underwrite Crimean international access (Passports and State Department programs) as well as pension & retirement re-investment guarantee financed in April. 

 OPPOSE  This is an obvious PR stunt by Putin.  There are no free reporters there and no way to verify what is actually happening.  Reprinting PR from Putin without clarification is incompetence. 

 (8) Russian military build-up on Ukraine south-east Russian border alerted by John Kerry as """"War-zone"""" readiness on 7 April. 

 So, It's still going on.  You should wait to see how things play out first. 

 (9) Further Ukrainian regional protests in other Ukrainian cities seeking Russian re-nationalization. 

 OPPOSE Are you people stupid?  Any protest without at least 10,000 verifiable people is not worth a mention on the wikipedia article for a nation.  This includes ALL the regional protests in Ukraine.  If it is worth a mention, then the U.S. page needs to have a few million more entries for """"protests"""".  Armed criminals supported by Putin could be mentioned, I guess. 

 (10) Russian authorized budget plans for Civic rebuilding of Crimea intrastructure including expanded new large scale spanning bridges for bridge links to Russian mainland. 

 OPPOSE  Wait for the bridge to be built, then write an article on that if you want.  They haven't even broken ground and you're already announcing it for the Putin PR machine.  Are you stupid or do you support Hitler . . . um, I mean Putin. 

 The armed invasion of Crimea by Russia after the Russian puppet president was deposed could deserve a mention.  A day by day, blow by blow updating should not occur as most of this is unverifiable or found to be completely wrong.  You need to have more discipline in your updating.  Most people do not come here for the latest news.  You do not need to feel that you have to provide this no matter what.

Yet there is this everlasting concerted attack on baronets etc. Please don't sit back on the laurels of the vagaries of 'notability'. There has to be a proper intelligent answer to these assaults. 

 :Here we have someone who was clearly notable. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for a major shire in Scotland, not a Crown Commission handed to every Tom Dick and Harry. He was also a sitting Magistrate, a position of obvious importance. Sir John served for two years in the Portuguese liberating army, something rather exceptional, to say the least, and he was in the Honourable East India Company's Bengal Army, for twelve years and was in 1845 a lieutenant and adjutant in their Bundelkund (cavalry) Legion. This must by anyone's standard be exceptional service. He wasn;t just on garrison duty at Edinburgh Castle! I mean, how many others do you know who had careers like this? He was later a Knight of Justice of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, a very select band, and the oldest of the most prestigeous Military Orders still extant.

 ==legal fiction== 
 Concerning """"a legal fiction""""; were I the original author, I might choose to open the article with a tone less aggressive and more informative to the layperson. """"Legal fiction"""" is a term of art.  I don't believe it should be the """"definitional headline."""" It is; however, accurate.  Restatement (Second) of Torts §283 comment c (1965) (""""The reasonable man is a fictitious person, who is never negligent, and whose conduct is always up to standard."""")  In Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490 the """"legal fiction"""" is implied. First, when the jury was instructed that the defendant was required to have acted as a """"prudent man"""" would have acted under those circumstances.  And then under review, the directive was deemed too vague.  Further, it was determined that a defendant acting honstly and bona fide to the best of his own judgement would afford no rule at all and leave open infinitely variable individual judgement. Nuance aside, the foundation for the """"legal fiction"""" for the basis of comparison exists. The """"reasonable person"""" is a fact assumed or created by courts.    

 To eliminate the """"citation needed"""" might I suggest: 
 * Bedder v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] 1 WLR 1119 (where """"reasonable man"""" is deemed a wholly impersonal fiction to which no special characteristic of the accused should be attributed) 
 * Camplin [1978] A.C. 705 (a reasonable man """"means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today"""") 
 * R v Smith (2000) 4 AER 289 (citing Champlin and Bedder: a preasonable man """"is a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him; and that the question is not merely whether such a person would in like circumstances be provoked to lose his self-control but also whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did"""") 
 That said, I maintain that a citation is of modest benefit if not entirely unnecessary. From conceptual inception, the question has never been """"is the 'reasonable person' fictional?"""" I submit the question has always been, 'Is a reasonable person defined in accordance with a particular normative ethical commitment or in accordance with an empirically observed practice or perception?' I posit that a reasonable person, possessed of minimal education, should have little difficulty exploring the nature of """"legal fiction"""" (given the link) were they so inclined.

I made NO judgements about ANY of the POV's of any counter-criticisms I cut and I mean NO Offense here.  I hope to see them ALL included in a section that is relevant such as maybe Responses to criticisms of feminism or whatever.  I cut them because they are completely irrelevant to the section as titled, because in some cases they completely buried the few short criticism statements themselves and because it is important to fully develop the criticisms, by themselves, before counter-criticising them if we are to understand these critisms at all. 
 
 I did add one little statement of (child abuse/parental abuse) content to one criticism because I happened, by coincidence, to have done the research for another article but I am not a member of that group, nor do I back that criticism as mine...I just saw it was relevant to that criticism and it may well need to be cut too unless THEY use it to back THEIR claims. 

 Finally, I tried to cleanup some tortured paragraphs by separating separate topics into new paragraphs, making it clear who was criticising in each PP and asking for specifics where I was confused as I read the content. 

 Again I hope to see the full scope of all criticisms and counter-criticisms included in this article with distint, complete and clear arguments.  This cleanup is in NO WAY meant to imply that any of these counter-arguments themselves were wrong or irrelevant...just that they do not belong in this section which is for the arguments against feminism themselves.

 == Ebony article? == 

 Does anyone have a citation to the 1990 Ebony article mentioned on this page?  A search of issues since 1989 (in an online database) turns up nothing that matches this description, and no 1990 articles that come at all close.  The reference was added by user Antares33712 at 20:19, 29 December 2005.  It's possible that my search results were incomplete, but it's also possible that the author misremembered the publication or the article details. 

 Because the current page accuses Ebony of printing misinformation (regarding Mariah Carey's race) and also suggests that the magazine article made other questionable claims, any mistake (either an inaccurate paraphrasing of an actual Ebony article, or a misattribution of someone else's article to Ebony) could be considered harmful to the magazine, and conceivably libellous.  I'm insufficiently familiar with Wikipedia's standards to take the step of removing it myself (I just added a """"fact"""" tag), but I wanted to call particular attention to the question in case others deem this the sort of thing that requires expedited action.  And of course, if someone does have a citation to add, or can correct any mistakes without deleting the entire reference, that would certainly be preferable!

But you can check out the Karma in Buddhism article which goes into all these points in detail. For instance Karma_in_Buddhism#Characteristics.  

 ::: Does that answer your question about sources? These points are common to all the Buddhist schools and covered in the sutras - but a Buddhist scholar would be best to give the sources for them if you want more details. 

 ::: Yes my comments are focused on Karma in Buddhism because that's the only form of Karma I know about.  

 ::: Yes - I know there is a great deal of discussion of these topics. For sure it would be good to have a discussion section here. I have no problem with it discussing and criticizing these ideas. The issue is with it calling these ideas Buddhist without any sources to back up the claim that they are Buddhist ideas - and within a framework of non Buddhist concepts.  

 ::: It would be good to have a proper informed discussion of karma and comparison of the different ways it is understood in different traditions and problems with it. But this isn't it.  

 ::: Indeed if you check the sources given for many of the comments here - they come from a series of articles whose authors - as best I can tell (they are rather technical theological articles) - are looking at the possiblity of applying the Eastern idea of karma to give an explanation of why a just and good God can permit a world with evil and suffering in it. The article I read didn't claim to be an overview of Eastern ideas of karma - but rather an application of them to theology. That's why it is imbued throughout with ideas from Western theology that do not fit well with Eastern ideas. 

 ::: So - if this material is included -it needs to be made clear where it comes from and what the discussion is - and given its proper context, and because the sources are articles by Western Christian theologians - at least the ones I followed up - that is another reason why it belongs in the Western section. 

 I hope that is clear, but sorry I am only a Buddhist practitioner and not a scholar and can't write such a section myself.

 Hi , 

 Thanks for that interesting stuff you have dug out on French attempts to cosy up to Japan against China before and during the Sino-French War.  I'm going to search Albert Billot's L'affaire du Tonkin, the standard French diplomatic history of the Sino-French War, to see if he can add anything to your research. 

 What I would like to do eventually is merge your new section into the existing section 'China's fear of Japan', and probably cut it down a bit.  At the end of the day, France and Japan did not become allies, and I think it unbalances the main article to devote so much space to something that never happened.  On the other hand, I've long been wanting to create a new article, Diplomacy of the Sino-French War, and that would be the natural home for a discussion of French overtures to Japan.  I'll try to get round to it before long. 

 I'll get back to you after I've seen what Billot has to say on the subject. 

    

 P.S.  Nice photo you uploaded of French soldiers in Tonkin in 1888. 

 P.P.S Can you spare a couple of minutes to do me another 'dioceses' template, 'Dioceses of the Syrian Orthodox Church'?  Just change the title from the present 'Dioceses of the Church of the East template and scrap the illustrations, and I'll do the rest.

 Chavez: ``there is a permanent revolution in Venezuela 
 By Roberto Jorquera 
 January 10,2007 marked the swearing in of Hugo Chavez as President of Venezuela. It was used by Chavez to reiterate and clarify the direction that the Bolivarian revolution would be taking during his term in office, which lasts till 2013. In his speech Chavez stated, ``This new period of constructing socialism has barely began. ``Jan 10 finishes the period of transition, this has been a transition of 3000 days (since the last constituent assembly), we are constructing the building which will be Venezuela's socialism, said Chavez. 

 Chavez used most of his speech to once again analyse and explain the history of the Bolivarian revolution since his failed military coup of 1992. But he also stressed that this will be a fundamentally new period in the Venezuelan revolution with many changes occurring quickly. ``People voted for a project a line of march which has been clarified as socialism. It is socialism that people need and that the country needs, said Chavez. 

 Most importantly Chavez emphasised the need to change the Venezuelan constitution and the need to make the Consejos Communales (communal councils) the fundamental and post important political decision making body in the country. Chavez said ``we need a constituent power in Venezuela that will draft a new constitution. This needs to have the revolutionary injection for the Bolivarian revolution. We need this so that the revolution never finishes, said Chavez. 

 On the issue of the constitution Chavez highlighted the need to change article 302 of the constitution which currently states, ``The State reserves to itself, through the pertinent organic law, and for reasons of national expediency, the petroleum industry and other industries, operations and goods and services which are in the public interest and of a strategic nature. Chavez made it clear that such an article was not specific enough and that it needed to include other natural resources on top of petroleum. 

 Another law that was singled out for change was the code on commerce which Chavez noted was over 100 years old and that the last change to the law was in 1955. ``What sort of socialism can we build with such laws, asked Chavez. ``There are many things in the constitution that we need to clarified and rewrite, said Chavez. 

 Chavez went further to state that, ``We have to get rid of any references to privatisation in the constitution we are not going to privatise anything anymore. It was made clear during his speech that the new government will move quickly on further state control of the main and strategic industries of the country. 

 During his speech Chavez stressed the need to strengthen communal power in Venezuela and that the revolution was just beginning but that no one should be worried about this next stage. Chavez once again used Trotsky to explain his position stating, ``Trotsky said that the revolution was permanent, it never finishes. Lets go with Trotsky. It is Trotsky who is correct that the revolution does not finish. 

 The final third of his speech concentrated on the political changes that needed to be undertaken in the new period. Chavez once again stressed the need of the importance of the United Socialist Party. ``What we need is unity, said Chavez. ``We are moving towards a united socialist party, which needs to be elected from the base, said Chavez. Also up for attention was the need to combat bureaucracy, inefficiency and corruption in the municipalities, which Chavez said was part of the fourth republic but needed to be eliminated. ``The fourth republic is still alive at the municipal level we need to dismantle it, said Chavez. 

 In relation to developing a new ``geometry of power in Venezuela Chavez stressed the need for a ``revolutionary explosion of communal power... Communal power needs to be the number one power. Chavez said that this was necessary as part of ``distributing economic, social, political and military power in Venezuela. 

 A new political structure was envisaged by Chavez which would not only develop and strengthen the communal councils but also work towards developing a federation of communal councils.``we need to create a system of cities which is based on federations, regions which are federal... It is part of building a socialist model which is part of a federal area that is organised by communal power, said Chavez.. 

 ``We need to build communal cities, socialist cities, said Chavez. ``They need to be able to make diagnostic assessment of their local area'', Chavez continued. ``We need a confederation of communal councils on a national level. We need to transform power to the communal power. Economic, political, power needs to be transferred to these local"

 == ANI's, Jews, etc. == 

 I hate getting involved with AN/I's in that I usually get beat up, and then I get pissed off, and then someone uses it against me in something.  So I thought I'd discuss this comment just on your talk page, which keeps it out of the central kerfuffle.  I think you jumped the proverbial shark to think that every Jew on Wikipedia belongs to some cabal (great word, since it's Hebrew in origin) that will block any critical article about Jews or Israel.  Though I'm a Jew, I'm highly critical of Israel, as are a lot of secular progressive Jews.  I see lots of articles about Palestine, or Hamas or Israel that is NPOV and criticizes Israel.  And you don't see us jumping up and down about it either.  But this article just had too much taken from Stormfront (by proxy, indirectly or directly, we'll never know), it was not academic at all, quote mining sources to further a stereotype, and the author just had too much history in antisemitic articles.  Nevertheless, it is unfair to generalize by this one article that every Jew on Wikipedia now feels empowered to create a JPOV that trumps NPOV.  This one article and one editor cannot be used as the strawman for Jewish articles in general.  And absolutely can't be used for anything about Israel.   

 OK, this is my opinion, and it wasn't cleared by any other Jewish person.

  Now this isssue should not be a matter of discussion at all, but equally we would like to see Wikipedia as accurate and credible in its outlook and the way it does reflect facts and the reality of events , from this point of view it seems inappropriate to put the flag of such coutry that does not exist in practice the Sahraouis are besed either in the Shara region within the Moroccan borders , or those who are living in the refugee camps in Tindouf in Algeria , it is perfectly true that an organisation called the  """"Polisario front"""" is in conflict with Morocco about the future of W sahara , but in practical terms there is no state ; first of all according to international law a state is defined by two main  factors ie: people and territory, secondly a recognition by the international community , up to now the polisario front is still based in Algeria and Sahraouis in the camps in the eyes of interrnational law are refugees , in addition to that there is no territory which is the main factor for any nation or people to claim an independant entity. 

 finally the United natons organization does not recognize the so -called RASD and most of the capitals of the world , in its resolution the UNSC talks about the polisario front. 
  Now it is obvious , and according to the argument above , in addition that Wikipedia is willing to maintain its credibility in terms of giving the right information, it will be wise to get rid of the flag until the conflict is over , if the Sahrouis managed to convince the international community and establish their own state in the W Sahara region then it will be appropriate to put the flag  simply because we will witness the creation of a new state , otherwise i believe that the flag in question should be removed for the sake of credibilty that we all are trying hard to maintain it .

I dont recall  that, although Ias soon as I said I would not be back. someone emailed me that I was nominated for deletion and that prompted my early return.    You asked why didn't I edit anywhere else at Wiki. I have seen errors, blatant lies, bias, and  misrepresentations on topics that I am well familiar with. I am not the expert- nor the only one with this information, but I do know right from blatantly wrong information.  That is what disturbs me so much and what I respond to.  If you are reading an article here, say it is 'Roza Bal', how would you know if something was being falsely presented unless someone corrects it? An example would be the page about Yuz Asaf. When  I was in Afghanistan I learned that 'asaph' means 'son of'...thus Yuz Asaph means son of Joseph.It does not mean 'gatherer' or 'healer of the lepers' or 'bodhisava' as presented on that page.   This isn't about self promotion of me or my book. It is about accurate reporting facts that can be checked (if you want to go to Afganistan-or read use of that word on old coins from the area). Further, people like Fida Hassnain come under attack and are belittled, and  I feel compelled to defend him. If you look at the dialogue on his page, you will see that page vandalism and personal attacks against Hassnain was the issue, not my book or inserting my web site. I asked Doug Weller to lock the page against disruptive editing. I have never done disruptive editing.. Never. Further, when students at Kashmir University created his page here (I could not because of the COI issue)  they included me. I didn't ask them and had no knowledge how their page would come out. Even the photo of Hassnain was deleted a few days ago when I was asked for that, I provided it...and even that small gesture was construed as an error of copyright. It wasn't and it is not...but it was presented as though it was as the reason for deletion. So what you and every Wiki editor is saying is that I can edit here all I want, but no one is ever allowed to mention me or my book anywhere at Wiki because I am not noteworthy, I am self-published and not credible, and every inclusion or correction or contribution I make will be viewed as a COI.

 On Sunday, March 11, the Washington Post published profiles written by Scott Wilson of two Israeli professors: Ilan Pappe and Benny Morris. The profile of Pappe, """"A Shared History, A Different Conclusion,"""" did not provide key context about why he is so reviled in Israel. 

 Ilan Pappe, a history lecturer at the University of Haifa, freely admits that, in his view, facts are irrelevant when it comes to the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. """"Indeed the struggle is about ideology, not about facts, Who knows what facts are? We try to convince as many people as we can that our interpretation of the facts is the correct one, and we do it because of ideological reasons, not because we are truthseekers,"""" Pappe said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Soir, Nov. 29, 1999. 

 Elsewhere, Pappe elaborated on his attitude toward historical investigation and academic objectivity: """"Historical Narratives . . . when written by historians involved deeply in the subject matter they write about, such as in the case of Israeli historians who write about the Palestine conflict, is motivated also...by a wish to make a point"""" (History News Network, April 5, 2004.) A more complete collection of Pappe's statements repudiating the value of historical facts is available here. 

 In light of Pappe's openness about his contemptuous view of scholarship, and his rejection of historical facts in favor of ideology, it is negligent that Scott Wilson's profile of him omits this key context. The piece portrayed the Haifa historian as a """"revisionist scholar"""" who languishes in """"nearly complete isolation"""" in Israel supposedly due to his alleged myth-busting research and political views, in which he opposes the existence of a Jewish state, even within its 1948 boundaries. For example, Wilson quotes without challenge Pappe's absurd allegation that """"My research debunked all of the lessons about Israel's creation that I had been raised on.""""   """

 From Earth: 
 """"In general English usage, the name earth can be capitalized or spelled in lowercase interchangeably, either when used absolutely or prefixed with """"the"""" (i.e. """"Earth"""", """"the Earth"""", """"earth"""", or """"the earth""""). Many deliberately spell the name of the planet with a capital, both as """"Earth"""" or """"the Earth"""". This is to distinguish it as a proper noun, distinct from the senses of the term as a mass noun or verb (e.g. referring to soil, the ground, earthing in the electrical sense, etc.). Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form as a variant of it. Another common convention is to spell the name with a capital when occurring absolutely (e.g. Earth's atmosphere) and lowercase when preceded by """"the"""" (e.g. the atmosphere of the earth). The term almost exclusively exists in lowercase when appearing in common phrases, even without """"the"""" preceding it (e.g. """"It does not cost the earth."""", """"What on earth are you doing?"""")."""""""

 == a few suggestions == 

 Hello, 

 I really appreciate wikicite - its a great tool!  I have three suggestions to make it better (I would do it myself, if I had the technical skills).  First, can you add an ISBN field in the book in the book citing section?  Currently I put it in the ID section, and then change ID to ISBN when I past the ref.  Secondly, when you include an author link, I find that it cuts off the last name and adds an extra set of brackets.  As an example, see the reference at the end of this sentence.  Thanks a lot, and keep up the great work!

 1.WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends. 

 2.An infection is growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the body, whether or not body function is impaired. Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick. Someone with an STI can unknowing pass on an infection – if they do not have any signs or symptoms, they are probably not aware they are carrying an infection and may not take the proper precautions of protecting their partner. 

 3.Disease is any change from a state of health; impaired body function. The disease state is associated with the manifestation of symptoms such as fever, pain, aches etc., due to failure of immune system to control in the first round of the growth of infectious agent (s). 

  
 These people don't run around all day looking for euphemisms. The use of the word """"infection"""" instead of """"disease"""" is based on real data,on a real stigma, on a real definition. The main most important point being Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick.   

 Compare this with HIV and AIDS. Do we use both terms interchangeably? 

  
 It should be stated very clearly in the intro that an infection doesn't imply symptoms. Maybe then this article won't be completely fucking useless. 

  
 PS:There's no reason for this or any article to be locked. The unknown unknown shitholes do far more damage than any """"vandal"""". In fact the name of this article was changed 6 years ago because of some """"anti-establishment"""" piece of shit didn't know the difference between an infection and disease. (Look at the archive for that idiot - a """"registered"""" user) Someone - an unregistered person - with a little sense: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sexually_transmitted_disease/Archive_3#Infection_vs._Disease 

 This entire article should be a case study of why this projects fails and continues to fail. If I had to take a wild intutive guess - I would guess that most people will not read the entire article but look for very important information quickly then leave. The project should be built around them. 

 I'm amazed by the astonishing ignorance revealed in the archives of this article. With the rationale of a word being familiar being used to justify against it's change.... jesus fucking chirst.

 The era classification in the History of the Ottoman Empire sidebox needs attention.  
 *The growth era is between 1453-1683. This means that the Ottoman Empire continued to grow in the 17th century. But it is not true. To be sure, Podolia and Crete were annexed. But  Anatolia, the core of the empire was in ruins. The empire was living the worst days as far as the public peace, cultural life and economy are considered. Vast areas in Caucasus and West Iran had been lost. The barbary states were almost independent. The reason the empire didn't disantegrate was the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The classical classification is better. The growth era must end by the end of the 16th century. (either by the death of Sokullu  Mehmet Pasha in 1579 or by the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606.) 
 *The dissolution era between 1908-1922 is quite meaningless. All Balkan countries (except Albania) and all African countries (except Libya) had already been lost by 1908 and the remainning territory was under the supervision of great powers of Europe. So I think the decline and dissolution must be treated together."

 == Rational versus irrational """"redesigning the existing"""" == 
 It occurs to me that, (especially with the military examples given here) there is often a rational reason why a state/country chooses to not use existing technology, but to design their own, but still these cases are often treated here as prime examples of NIH syndrome, and that is not the case at all! 
 I think that in those cases it has nothing to do with the NIH syndrome.  
 For example, it would be foolish for a state to be dependent on their enemies for the supply of their weapons! It is much smarter to (re-)design your own, so you can be sure you can produce the damn things when needed.  

 The NIH syndrome has nothing to do with that.  
 Instead NIH as """"a decision maker"""" is the often subconscious mind process not to use technology (or """"a design"""") because you dislike doing so for some un-outspoken reason, a reason the decision maker does not know he is using!  
 One example is that you do it simply because you dislike the country/person/company that is the origin of the design.  
 When the decision is however a conscious one, backed with good reasons, it is NOT the NIH syndrome at work.  """

I hope they don't."""" This comment had the effect of producing a widespread exodus from the ashrams that year, which gave rise to an individualistic attitude. This was reflected in Alan's outlook at the close of 1976. """"Everyone is beginning to see that Divine Light Mission is just a bunch of people trying to meditate and love each other. All the holier-than-thou bullshit is crumbling. I don't have to wait for Guru Maharaj Ji to communicate through all the layers of leadership to me in order to learn what I need to know.

 Preface 

 """"Ashram creates itself so holy an environment that when a car passes right there in front of an ashram, the driver feels some strange feeling in his tires. Something so holy, something so attractive, something so elegant, because in this world, we can walk in the streets and we can see the lights and when you drive at night, you might feel a strange reaction because of all these lights there. But in the ashram, no lights, but internal light's still glowing. Everyone is completely amazed when he sees the light coming through, because when people meditate, there is clearly light coming out of them. 

 """"And when man does meditation, then it really comes out of him, he becomes a part of the meditation, like if you go to a tub and there is white paint in it, and you go down in the tub and come out, then you'll be all white, because that white color has touched you and become a part of you. So, when we stick to something, when we stick to Knowledge, we become a part of Knowledge. 

 """"And what is Knowledge? Knowledge is light. And we have to become light and everyone wants to become light. He glows, but not for himself he glows, he glows for everyone. If I'm a man, and I have got a torch and there are a hundred people following me, they can all see clearly, because if only one man has a torch, a hundred people can see. So when you glow, you don't show direction to yourself, but you show how to be, how to be. 

 """"Now you see, God is the controller, it is His control trip. Why do you only see with your eyes, why not with your mouth or with your nose? Why only with your eyes? You talk about it being a control trip, then why do you only see with your eyes and not with your mouth? Why? Because that's the way things are, and that's the way things are going to be, understand? A man who sees through his mouth, you're not going to call him a man. You're going to call him a monster! A man must see through his eyes and that's the way it must be. 

 """"Ashram has to be an ashram and it's not a motel. You don't go into a church and just start sleeping there and drinking your coffee there. You don't do that, do you? A church is a church, a temple is a temple; you are strict about doing certain things there. Understand? You go to a church; you pray, you meditate, you read something, you understand something, and become more spiritual, right? 

 """"Why should there be so much strictness? We are the children of God, and this is the house of God. That's why there should be so much strictness. That's the way it has to be, that's why. So that's what I wanted to make clear about it."""" 

 (Note: the above quotes are from Guru Maharaji himself. They've been lifted from satsangs Guru Maharaj Ji gave - during ashram pressure-cooker meetings - to the Ashram premies in the early 70s, and those quotes constitute the preface of the 'Ashram Manual'.) 

 Part One: The Renunciate Order 

 The Renunciate Order is a monastic order of Divine Light Mission. Its members pursue a life of complete worldly renunciation for the purpose of engaging in religious study and dedication to selfless service of God and humanity. Renunciates live in disciplined environments known as Ashrams, which are created and operated by Divine Light Mission for the spiritual growth of their members.

This month long discussion we are currently in, is the only serious discussion of changing the lead that has been proposed.  The language re: the number and names of the investigations was placed in the lead sometime in late 2006/2007. In September of 09, someone replaced that language with """"Oswald is the assassin"""", which instituted a discussion that lasted half a day.  I replaced that edit with the language that was there until Rudioso showed up about a month ago.  The point in relaying this history is that the edit history does not support that there has been some longstanding feud about the language of this introduction or that mentioning the investigations will somehow allow these discussion to continue.  In fact, the actual history tells us that the only time objections arise is when editors change it to state Oswald is the assassin.  Rudioso is the first and only editor who's objected to the statements of investigations since it's been introduced.  Now, I'm all for trying something new, but I think that since none of the proposals have garnered the support required to claim a new consensus it is best that we go back to what was there before Rudioso briefly objected.  That version clearly had consensus, something that no new proposal has garnered.

 == intellexual review == 

 This website has been debated time and time again. It has been removed after much debate spanning over 2 years. There have been many reasons stated for and against this web sites inclusion. But the reasons for its removal was best summed up with  comments 
 :the intellexual.net review is unsigned and is published on what appears to be an unknown individual's personal web site, its subject was a technologically unremarkable product which is long defunct and whose performance may bear little relation to that of its successors, and it discusses the product in a gleefully negative framework that is anything but neutral and unbiased and is thus of dubious value as an encyclopedic link [..] Besides, if that stale and biased review is the most credible link that we skeptics can come up with, I'd say that's pretty sad.   
 So please don't link this site its POV it lacks verifiability and is tested on a particular product not made by Bose since the late 90's.    

 :Yes, but you don't write the rules. There is no wiki rule that says that objective measurements have to be signed, or calibrated, so the comments about the frequency remain. If you can find objective measurements of a Bose system that are more to your liking, please post them. Personally I thought my summary of that page was uncontroversial.   

 ::you don't write the rules??? Ok please try to keep this civil... please! I have only been following them and it is very clear this this is a highly biased page and rather questionable. If you check you would see that it does not meet the standards of Verifiability: 
 ::*third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.  
 ::*Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for fact-checking or with no editorial oversight. Questionable sources should only be used in articles about themselves. (See below.) Articles about such sources should not repeat any contentious claims the source has made about third parties, unless those claims have also been published by reliable sources. 
 ::*Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources 
 ::**Self-published material may, in some circumstances, be acceptable when produced by an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications. However, caution should be exercised when using such sources: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so. 
 ::*If no reliable, third-party sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it. 
 ::This web page fails everything, it has NO reputation for fact checking, these claims have not been cited from other reliable 3rd party sources, This person is not an expert or has he been credited as being an expert in the audio field, and has no notable published works aside from this single page. 
 ::Nor does it pass reliability: 
 ::*Reliable sources are authors or publications regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand 
 ::*Reliable publications are those with an established structure for fact-checking and editorial oversight. 
 ::*In general, an article should use the most reliable and appropriate published sources to cover all majority and significant-minority published views, in line with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. 
 ::*In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers.

 :Kitty, you should read the prior Talk page posts, because your objections have been addressed (some of them repeatedly). The change isn't my personal opinion. Rather, I'm drawing the well-established policy on national varieties of English; and I addressed the four guidelines of the policy in the first comment here. You state that every person knows the word """"presents"""" in the context of the host of a news program. That is incorrect. As I noted more than once above, Americans don't use the verb """"present"""" to describe what a news anchor does. I didn't know the word was used in such a way until I started using Wikipedia. Americans may think someone who presents is the producer or a commercial sponsor. Either word might confuse some people. So the English variety settles the matter. American English is the proper variety. It was the first variety used and consistency should be maintained throughout the article. Melissa Lee is a U.S. citizen, born in New York state in the U.S. She resides in the U.S., works in the U.S., and is employed by a U.S. news channel. The article is considered a U.S. topic under the policy that uses the American variety of English. It is claimed that whether the word is a noun or a verb is significant. It's not. The articles that use anchor as a noun, also use it as a verb (e.g. Connie Chung) because they're from the same national variety of English.

 Hey, long time no talk. I'm looking at the PC 2014 RFC and noticed your name supported proposal one and two. Is that possible? Also, is there really any difference between the two?    
 :Hey ! Yes, I supported both because I see instances on which these two might be used. The main difference is that the first proposal is aimed at autoconfirmed users (Use PC2 instead of blocking them, since semiprotection wouldn't work) and the second does not differentiate any use types (applies to all users, and is used as a substitute to full protection). So, I support both because I see PC2 as a plausible solution in many instances where content creation cannot be delayed in spice of having socks or autoconfirmed users edit warring or something.

Editors interested in the retention of this article should work to improve it to make be meet Wikipedia policy or it stands a fair chance of coming up for AfD again. -   

 Oh, and also note Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Curbing, again, essentially the same article. -   

 ==Recreated== 

 It's honestly better than nothing.-unsigned 

 This article is in worse shape than the orginal one, which was deleted. I got rid of most of the garbage, but much work is still needed if this article is going to stay.   

 == Seriously Sick Shit == 

 I think this entire topic should be erased. Young men don't need to read this shit. It's disturbing. I'm disturbed. I feel sick. 

 :Wikipedia:Content disclaimer. Please read this. Wikipedia is not censored.   

 Yeah, it is a horrible thing to do, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be included. By that logic, a discussion of, say, ethnic cleansing shouldn't be included, because its 'disturbing'.   

 You're an idiot.    

 It shouldn't be on wikipedia because you think 'young men' shouldn't read about it? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You ARE an idiot.    

 == Disputed == 

 The idea of """"curb stomping"""" seems to be well-known primarily because of its inclusion in American History X.  It also seems there's a lot of urban lore about the practice.  I've seen a few references here and there to it occuring in real life, but can anyone provide some hard information on the subject?     

 I am an Australian and I have never heard of this practice being called a """"smiley"""" here.   Nathan 

 Check http://forums.comicbookresources.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&daysprune;=&f;=25 for numerous examples of how """"curbstomping"""" is used as a synonyme to """"completely dominating an opponent"""".   

 I first encountered curb stomping in the 1983 book """"Gardens of Stone"""" by Nicholas Proffitt. The incident was explicitly described, but I don't think it made it into the 1987 movie version. Anyone got an earlier reference?   

 Just because you haven't heard the term as """"smiley"""" doesn't mean that's not what it is. I have heard the term used as """"california smiley"""" quite a long time ago. It's probably an American  not an Australian  thing. 

  Klasanov  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 == curb stomp == 

 This is quite a nasty video so if you have a weak stomach dont watch it!  Delete if deemed to inappropriate. 

 http://www.ebaumsworld.com/2006/07/curbstomp.html 

 I'm not a wiki-editor or anything, just browsing. That eBaumsworld video is actually a staged move, the guy who is """"stomped"""" was willing as you can see he raises his arms up, furthermore it's not performed on a curb if you observe closely it's a flourescent light tube for the whole smash effect, it was actually a amateur wrestling clip and is therefore irrelevant.   

 == Added 'Disputed' Tag == 

 Frankly, this article needs sources to prove the practice commonly exists in the real world and is not just a movie creation. —

 ::I find I have to agree with Teque. The introduction, for example, basically notes that some people have positive opinions of non-commercial dog food, and some people have negative opinions of commercial dog food. There is no point in either of those statements. The """"Commercial dog food"""" section appears to make a comparison of canned and dry food, where the facts in question are that dry food is cheaper, lasts longer, and is """"more convenient"""", and that canned food spoils faster but has a longer shelf life, and contains more protein on a dry matter basis. This isn't exactly appropriate, and all of these facts are mentioned again in the article, so this comparison seems intended to criminalize dry dog food. Further, the concept of """"dry matter"""" probably needs to be explained, as anyone who hasn't taken a Nutrition course is unlikely to know what that means. If you dried out wet dog food, and then— without the water weight— compared it on a gram to gram scale with dry dog food, yes, it would have more protein. However, a serving of wet food is mostly moisture, while a serving of dry dog food is mostly dry matter. So, as I understand, a dog gets a higher quantity of protein from a serving of dry food than a serving of wet food. I haven't added this to the article myself because I'm only repeating what I've been taught, I'm not intimately familiar with the subject. Moving on, in the """"Alternate dog food"""" sections, it is insinuated that commercial dog foods have no or significantly less nutritional value than alternate dog foods (freeze dried, I believe, to be specific); a more appropriate statement would possibly be that freeze dried foods retain more of their natural nutrients, while processed foods add nutrients back artificially. Next, the statement """"Many commercial dog foods are made from materials considered unusable or undesirable"""" is entirely opinionated. A statement that some ingredients can be unhealthy could be acceptable if backed by a citation of scientific research. Further, any list of """"contents"""" should not include only """"undesirable"""" ones. It should include all common ingredients. Otherwise, the list should be removed, as it draws focus to those specific ingredients. I just have to note, the only line in this section that suggests dry food has any value whatsoever is that expensive foods may contain """"suitable"""" ingredients. It's true that the cheapest brands have the quality of shoe leather, and any brand with adequate nutrition will be more expensive, but no note is made that the expensive food brands tend to be, nutritionally, very healthy for dogs. As well, there is mention of some of the less savory by products that are allowed into foods by AAFCO, but no mention of the nutritional requirements necessary to be AAFCO certified. I'm not saying that having cow brains in dog food is desirable, but it should also be noted that dog food must meet certain nutritional standards to be AAFCO certified. Generally, the difference is considered to be that between """"complete"""" and """"complete and balanced"""". A dog can survive on a solely complete diet, whereas a balanced diet is actually healthy (and necessary to be AAFCO certified). Interestingly, many prescription diets aren't AAFCO certified, because they will often deliberately reduce some kind of nutrient, like sodium. While this might have ill effects on a typical dog, it's more healthy for one having heart problems. On the same topic, under """"Labeling"""", AAFCO certification is disparaged. However, the only source for this is a person's opinion. The main point seems to be that AAFCO standards are worthless— whether or not they are, I couldn't say— but the point should be that the organization requires food to meet healthier standards. Next, a question— if there's an entire article on 2007 dog food recalls, is it necessary to go into such detail here? A more abridged form, like that used for """"past recalls"""", that directs readers to the separate article might be more appropriate. Overall, the article focuses on negatives of dry dog food and does not allow for the facts that some types of dry dog food are very healthy, that some types of wet food may be unhealthy, or that some alternate foods may not be healthy. Further, there is an over-reliance on this type of statement: """"Some argue..."""" """"Some maintain..."""" """"Proponents criticize..."""" """"Supporters believe..."""" """"Critics argue..."""" The majority of which, I'd like to note, promote negative opinions of dry dog food. Just because it is someone else's opinion, though, does not make it any less of an opinion. Most of these statements lack any support or citations, as well."""

 I've added a category of """"partial virtualization"""" between """"full virtualization"""" and """"paravirtualization"""". Although this may not sit well with everybody, I think we need a category for a system like IBM M44/44X – with virtual machines and multiple address spaces, but not full hardware simulation and the ability to boot multiple operating systems. There is a fuzzy line between such a system and any OS that provides address space isolation. Or rather there really is no such line, and all such operating systems could be considered in the same category. We wouldn't tend to view them as virtual machine systems today, but they were a huge step forward from earlier approaches to multitasking.

 Memorandum For The Record 
 MASINT is one of the departments of the new US National Directorate  ofIntelligence

 UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY - WHO WE ARE 
 The Director of National Intelligence establishes the NRO’s collection priorities 
 and ... the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Central MASINT Office, ... 
 NRO mission partners are the National Security Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Central MASINT Office, and the United States Space Command. 

 MASINT straddles strict disciplinary definitions.  It 
           may use collection techniques of, but does not fit 
           neatly into any one or all of the more recognized 
           """"traditional"""" disciplines of IMINT, SIGINT, HUMINT, etc. 

      -    MASINT is the least understood of the disciplines and is 
           perceived as a """"strategic"""" capability with limited 
           """"tactical"""" support capabilities.  However, MASINT has a 
           potential ability to provide real-time situation 
           awareness and targeting not necessarily available from 
           the more classic disciplines. 

      -    MASINT is a science-intensive discipline that needs 
           people/scientists well versed in the broad range of 
           physical and electrical sciences.  Such scientists can 
           not typically be professionally developed with the IC. 
           They must come from academia fresh with scientific 
           knowledge from experimentation and research.  Nor can 
           they continue to be """"proficient"""" in their areas of 
           expertise if they remain in government employ for an 
           entire career. 
 http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/house/intel/ic21/ic21007.html 

 Evidently any unrespectable weird stuff like alien UFOs & paranormal & zero point dark energy exotic weapons technology allegations would be the concern of MASINT on the chance that there is something real there and that some inside USG know something we do not despite all the plausible deniability and the smoke screen provided by CSICOPS and the """"Cranks"""" that are two sides of the same coin. If the Cranks did not exist CSICOPS would have to invent them, indeed, sometimes they do! ;-)

It was me making that connection that caused him to telephone me at SDSU to come to ICTP in 1973. Jagdish Mehra may have notes on this. I went to Brussels to see Prigogine & Robert Brout. Merhra was there and he was also at ICTP. Brout was one of my tutors at Cornell in group theory.

Outside of the very specific context of Jews who actually loathe their heritage/ethnicity/religious-background (such as the """"true believer"""" guy), this term is a purely pejorative term. There is no evidence to suggest that Mises or Rothbard were self-loathers. In fact, Mises fled Europe in order to escape the Reich, which is not something that he needed to do if he was a self-loathing Jew. We know that there are plenty of Jews who collaborated with the National Socialists. Anyway, this is not proof of anyone's internal goings-on, but it can offer a clue as to the likelihood that claims of anti-semitism or self-loathing may be true. None of this biographical info about Mises has any direct bearing on the content of the article. What does have direct bearing, however, is the actual definition of anti-semitism as enumerated here on wikipedia.

She defines anti-Semitism as """"a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions – social or legal discrimination, political mobilisation against the Jews, and collective or state violence – which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."""" 
 ::::Since Rockwell is anti-collectivist (seeing individuals as such, not as part of some larger collective) and anti-state (therefore against the very possiblity of legal discrimination for anyone, not to mention political mobilization), that rules out anti-semitism on his part at least by this definition. 
 :::*Professor Dietz Bering of the University of Cologne further expanded on Professor Fein's definition by describing the structure of anti-Semitic beliefs. To anti-Semites: """"Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."""" 
 ::::Again, Rockwell's life's work is contra collectivism. It is hard to believe that he might secretly be a closet collectivist. Since Rockwell played a role in Rothbard business endeavors, thus supporting Rothbard's lifestyle, to some extent, it seems that he could not have secretly been conspiring to kick the """"alien Jew"""" out of the country. 
 :::*If anything (and I say this somewhat tongue in cheek, since I don't think that there is evidence to attribiute this view to Rockwell), Sobran, Francis, and other """"racialists"""" argue that Jews are superior in terms of intelligence, etc. If one were to claim that Rockwell was influenced by this racialist thinking (which has usually been the claim here; mostly accusing him of consorting with/promoting such types as Francis, Sobran, et al.), one could hardly claim that Rockwell qua racialist could ALSO be an anti-semite racist. If it is the case that he does believe that such distinctions exists, this dos NOT automatically imply that he is an anti-semite, primarily because racialism is , by itself, value free. It does not speak to the superiority of a particular """"race"""" (which, by the way, I think to be an entirely contrived concept), but only to their objective differences, which, as I say, has no bearing on subjective valuations (such as judgements about the relative value of intelligence, physical prowess, certain colors of hair, etc.). Even if convicted of """"racialism"""", Rockwell would still not be demonstrably guilty of """"anti-semitism."""" I think it is certainly our job as wikipedia editors to use terms as they are defined on wikipedia. You agree, n'est-ce pas?  16:17"""

"06fd8ace95035b86","== traffic cone uses == 

  
 A traffic cone or a safety cone is more than just a cone-shaped marker that is placed on the roads, accident sites, or footpaths to, temporarily, redirect traffic and public in a safe manner. These safety cones are used nowadays for many purposes such as merging lanes during construction projects or informing the oncoming traffic about an accident. 

 These road cones are commonly used by police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to block off areas where nothing should be moved around and to highlight areas that require great attention of the motorists or pedestrians because of low visibility. These safety cones are also used in outdoor spaces to cordon off crime scenes and other incidents. The cones are also used in indoor public spaces to mark off areas (to denote a dangerous area or any other area) that would be closed to the pedestrians and protecting roadside workers working for construction projects. 

 Nowadays, event management companies are making use of the traffic cones to cordon off vehicle drop-off points and denote VIP entry areas or marshalling areas so that things can be effectively managed as per their plans. These cones can be used to line a lane that requires construction besides keeping workers inside the area safe; the safety cones can also be used for keeping cars and other vehicles away from entering unsafe areas. These days, safety cones are also used to warn birds, especially the endangered black-browed albatross, from colliding with fishing gear and guarding them against deadly entanglement. If that is not all, these safety cones are also used in offices and other places to highlight and identify safety hazards such as a wet floor. 

 All these benefits of traffic cones surely suggest that these cone-shaped objects help in creating and maintaining high standards of street and worksite safety for workers, motorists, and pedestrians.

 Some things that happen in the plot may make more sense if it is mentioned that Ivan hasn't spoken to Pepa, but has been leaving phone messages. For example, the end of the plot description mentions the important news but there was nothing earlier in the article about her having news she wants to tell him. I added something at least alluding to her needing to talk to him. 

 The reason for these disconnected details may result from the Wiki instructions at the top to cut down on the plot; my elaborating on those details may have run counter to this instruction. The only way to make the plot shorter is to avoid and episodic description and just mention some of the crucial elements of the plot. Unfortunately, I don't have time to do this and I haven't watched the film recently so there's a couple of things I'm unclear on. For example, the Spanish wiki article on the movie says the Gazpacho was prepared for Ivan. Earlier, this article said it was for a suicide attempt by Pepa. So, I just finessed that by leaving out of the plot description the reason for the Gazpacho being there."

 == Mother section == 

 Regarding my changes to mother section:  
 * """"他媽的"""" (ta ma de) is an interjection that you would use to express discontent at someone (hence the word 他). The interjection is often followed up by sentences. In terms of restraint, it does not show much refrain, as the speaker is assume to be fairly mad/upset. However, in terms of vulgarity, it is fairly mild as it does not contain any curse words. It can be used inline as an adjective, although the meaning/vulgarity of the sentence would be the same as if the person used it as an interjection.  
 ** """"damn"""" is used to to express dismay at things that had happened. In my opinion, it is a fairly mild curse. """"damn"""" shows more restraint, so i chose """"goddamn it"""" as translation. Also in my impression, """"damn"""" alone also shows some degree of acceptance of the thing that happened.  
 ** """"shit"""" when used as an interjection is more like a realization of something bad had happened, so the emotion is more like disbelief or panic. So the meaning is quite different.  
 * """"他媽的鳥"""" (ta ma de niao) almost the same as above, except more vulgar. And cannot be used as an adjective.  
 * """"去你奶奶的"""" (qu ni nai nai de), """"去你媽的"""" (qu ni ma de), """"去你的"""" (qu ni ma de) are phrases responding to a disagreeable verbal phrase. It is not very vulgar. In fact so not vulgar, that you can use it in a friendly fashion to a good friend.  
 ** former translation """"fuck off"""" is usually used in response of being bothered, doesn't have to be directed at a phrase. """"Fuck off"""" also attempts to end the topic or telling the person to leave. Neither of the Chinese phrase has that. In my experience, """"fuck off"""" cannot be used in a friendly manner. So chose """"your mom"""" and """"shut the fuck up"""" as better suited translations.  
 * the last two, I just changed mother to mom because 媽=mom, while 母亲=mother.  
 * I removed """"kill your mother"""" because i don't think anyone would interpret 干 as kill.  """

 The article claimed: Some claim Sorbs share ancestry with Serbs. According to one of the hypotheses, in the 5th century, after leaving their proto-Slavonic homeland, common ancestors of all Serbs and Sorbs divided into two groups. One of the groups (the ancestors of the Serbs), known as the White Serbs, reached the Balkans through the Carpathian Mountains under the leadership of the Unknown Archont, whilst the others settled in the middle part of the Elbe and become 'Sorbs'. The story depicted in Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos' De Administrando Imperio tells that a brother of the Archont had remained in what is today Lusatia with a part of the Serb people.  

 One part of this is not a use different to the one covered in the articles, because it is already covered in the article.  The rest is unreferenced, likely to be either original research or a hoax. See the relevant articles. And it is not relevant for the subject of Wends anyway.

 ==EAAN== 
 You suggested several times that ID and EAAN are intimately related. You then blocked the discussion, so people can't dicuss the topic anymore. Because of this, I'm posting the arguments in you talk-page. Alternatively you could unlock the discussion page again, because to most people who understand EAAN the article is now in a dissatisfying condition and we'd like to discuss its improvement. 
  It seems there are two main arguments on your side: 
 :Plantinga presented the argument at Intelligent Design conferences (Creationism's Trojan Horse p269). 
 :It has been discussed in a book about ID and its critics. 
 Here is my response. 
 :# The argument is an argument against Naturalism given evolution. It can't be reformed to be an argument against evolution given naturalism, because as Plantinga says himself, """"for the naturalist evolution is the only game in town"""". James Beilby writes in his foreword to Plantingas Argument(Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism - Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism, 2002, p. vii)  """"Plantinga's argument should not be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic. It is the conjunction of naturalism and evolution that suffers from the crippling deficiency of self-defeat, a deficiency not shared by the conjunction of theism and current evolutionary doctrine."""" The conclusion of the argument is interesting for any non-naturalist or theist (and may be presented at any conference concerning all sorts of theisms/deisms). But this doesn't relate the argumet more intimately to ID than any argument of natural theology. As a matter of fact, an ID proponent has a problem deploying the argument: if he convinces his naturalis friend of the truth of ID instead of evolution, he can't use EAAN anymore, since evolution is a premis of EAAN. 
 :#EAAN is in the book for the mentioned reasons. There is also a chapter on theistic evolution in the book. Yet, theistic evolution clearly isn't related to ID in the sense required by wikipedia. 
 :#Plantinga may or may not agree to evolution. He may even be a proponent of ID (which is not at all clear). But even if he was a fierce proponent of ID, this doesn't automatically relate all his work to ID. I have read quite a lot of Plantingas work (Knowledge of god, god and other minds, naturalism defeated, God, Freedom, and Evil, The Analytic Theist: An Alvin Plantinga Reader and some essays) and he never so much as mentions ID. ID is not present in his work and most notably EAAN is not related to ID, because it has evolution as its premise.  
 I hope to have convinced you that for the sake of the quality of wikipedia the ID passage and tag should be gone. If this is not enough, we'll have to let other people decide who's got the better arguments. 
 Thanks.  """

 ::Firstly, making up non existent words such as death crime or death defence to argue that death penalty is inappropriate word is spurious. In fact you are somewhat making my point.  You say capital punishment is tied to capital crime. """"Capital"""" denote ultimate or prime or ultimate, making reference to severity or significance. So it can refer to a city (London) as well as crime or penalty. """"Death"""" is a matter of fact reference to the content. For this reason, death city makes no sense. In reverse, death penalty is more matter of fact (NPOV) reference than capital punishment. Moreover, your claim that that """"We (American?) uniformely describe crimes elibigle for capital punishment as capital crimes"""". A simple google search shows that the claim of uniformality is not sustainable even in U.S.A. 

 ::Secondly, your made a claim in term of general usage. Therefore, google search with few millions sample is infintely more authoritative source than your sample (few entries dictionaries which subsequently equate DP and CP anyway). Even if we somewhat restrict ourselves to academic reference (which include legal dictionary or encycropedia), google scholar search, which make comprehensive search of academic papers, shows that death penalty is more common reference. You can also make few other type of search. Try using google news, which makes comprehensive reference to journalism. It shows overwhelming usage of death penalty over capital punishment. Or try using ask.com search which uses subject-specific link popularity to compute """"authoritativeness"""" of a search result. Again it shows that death penalty is more common reference.  Most top search for DP are from U.S as well. Capital punishment may be more common usage in sentencing which is a specific legal procedure in jurisprudence (which explain legal dictionary reference). This restcited context cannot be used to argue for commonality of usage of capital punishment both in public, journalism and academic world. This is another indication that DP is more NPOV than CP. Anyway, if you want to use few dictionaries entry as your evidence, feel free to do so. We appear to be heading to arbitration process. Consensus is prefered but not to the extent of filbuster. Ultimately, I don't have to convince the opposing advocate(s). I only have to convince the jury (arbitrator) that my case is more NPOV than yours. """

 I thought you might find it useful to have some information about  references (refs) on wikipedia. These are important to validate your writing and inform the reader. Any editor can remove unreferenced material; and unsubstantiated articles may end up getting deleted, so when you add something to an article, it's highly advisable to also include a reference to say where it came from. Referencing may look daunting, but it's easy enough to do. Here's a guide to getting started. If you need any assistance, let me know.  ''''''''  

 ;Good references 

 A reference must be accurate, i.e. it must prove the statement in the text. To validate """"Mike Brown climbed Everest"""", it's no good linking to a page about Everest, if Mike Brown isn't mentioned, nor to one on Mike Brown, if it doesn't say that he climbed Everest. You have to link to a source that proves his achievement is true. You must use reliable sources, such as published books, mainstream press, and authorised web sites. Blogs, Myspace, Youtube, fan sites and extreme minority texts are not usually acceptable, nor is original research (e.g. your own unpublished, or self-published, essay or research), or another wikipedia article. 

 ;Inserting a reference 

 The first thing you have to do is to create a """"Notes and references"""" section (unless it already exists). This goes towards the bottom of the page, below the """"See also"""" section and above the """"External links"""" section. Enter this code: 

 :==Notes and references== 
 :{{reflist}} 

 The next step is to put a reference in the text. Here is the code to do that. It goes at the end of the relevant term, phrase, sentence, or paragraph to which the note refers, and after punctuation such as a full stop, without a space (to prevent separation through line wrap): 

 :              

 Whatever text you put in between these two tags will become visible  in the """"Notes and references"""" section as your reference. 

 ;Test it out 

 Open the edit box for this page, copy the following text (inserting your own text where indicated), paste it at the bottom of the page  and save the page: 

 :==Reference test== 

 :This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.Reference details go here 

 :==Notes and references== 

 :{{reflist}} 

 (End of text to copy and paste.) 

 It should appear like this: 

 :;Reference test 

 :This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.Reference details go here 

 :;Notes and references 

 : 

 ;Information to include 

 You need to include the information to enable the reader to find your source. For an online newspaper source, it might look like this: 

 :Plunkett, John.  [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html """"Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying""""], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  2005-10-27. Retrieved on 2005-10-27.

 * """"if person x is presented with an option to specify his/her ethnicity and s/he answers one thing but means another, that person is an idiot""""  
 ** IMHO, a too strong word, but with correct sign. However, you can not put together 3 million idiots and say all Moldovans are idiots. Moreover, if I mean I am x as a subset of y, and I am asked to choose between x and y, without given the choice """"x subset of y"""", then whatever I declare, according to your criteria I would be an idiot. Now, a sufficiently educated person (read top 5% can thing thoroughly about all implications of all answers, and answer intelligently but insincerely y). The rest answer sincerely x meaning x as a subsets of y, and you call them idiots. The problem I see is not what people declare, but what you chose not to know about, or rather to ignore. For example, you know so much about people, history, and 1000 other things related to the Romanian Old Kingdom, that I couldn't believe possible for a humble human being (as opposed to a machine). On the other hand, IMHO you chose to not even bother know quite simple things about Transylvania, Bukovina or Bessarabia. The problem is, that given your encyclopedic knowledge on some things, it's surreal to see you (pretend you) don't know simple things on other things. Such as for example that your interpretation in this issue is 100% identical to communists' one, and ignores what the rest of the world (forget Romania) warns about.   
 * """"anecdotic evidence"""" such as how they supposedly posed the question don't make the cut here. I also know that this kind of evidence can only hope to persuade me personally, by appealing to what I would find likely 
 ** yes, I mean to point it to you only. Have you ever been in Harghita or Covasna in the situation when each one pretends not to understand the other, while both perfectly understand everything? ) The same is during the census. The problem is who fills the paper: you or the census person. This question in Moldova was like putting in an American census a question """"George W. Bush / Barrack Obama (erase one) is a piece of s&%t"""". Census official would have a strong opinion about it. So they do in Moldova. To quote Stalin: """"it doesn't matter who run the elections, it matters who counts the votes"""".  
 * Because it's not reality: it's a theory, a biased theory, and I have the responsibility and intellectual honesty not to present a biased claim for a fact. The most that can and should be achieved here is a citation of reliable, non-partisan sources that question the Moldovan census results (not unionist blogorama, not personal deductions about what happened there or elsewhere) 
 ** It is a claim, but not biased. And not, please, never use my claims as facts. They are only meant to present the situation to you the way I see it. They can point you to be more careful how you understand some details, but they are not meant ever to be substituted to a sourse. However, in 2004 Moldovan Census you have (and always had) a reference that cuts the chaise. (I never cite blogorama, except when it's the author's article). The only point I am making is that caution should be taken on how the results on ethnicity and language questions are interpreted. To the issue: the best IMHO is to say both POVs whenever that is possible. IMHO, accepting communist POV is biased, even if you pretend it is not the communist POV but your own understanding. With all due respect, that would be precisely """"intellectual dishonesty"""" (to know something and say the opposite, or worse, pretend not to notice).  
 * but I don't see anybody who supports Romanian patriotism going out of his/her way to subtract the troglodyte mass from the total number of Romanians.  
 ** Depends what you call patriotism. I am sure you are patriot and you do subtract them. And I hope I could be characterized likewise. The only problem is I don't see ethnicity """"troglodyte"""". So, for example, as much as I dislike Vadim or the like, I cannot cound him in any other ethnicity.

 == """"Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC, while hedge funds are not""""/regulation in general == 

 This is simply wrong.  Investment Advisers (the managers of hedge funds) in the US are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  There are many aspects of the Act that apply both to registered and unregistered advisers.  The most important of these provisions are anti-fraud measures.  The SEC enforces the Act.   

 Registered IAs can count on a visit from the SEC on a schedule determined by the adviser/fund's perceived riskiness.  To try and draw some kind of distinction between an adviser being regulated and a fund being regulated is pointless: when the SEC visits, they are empowered to review all aspects of an adviser's funds. 

 The SEC can use Rule 206(4)-8 under the Act to come in and look at an unregistered adviser's funds, as well.   

 More, it is ludicrous to state that hedge funds are """"largely unregulated,"""" although this phrase is repeated in the popular press frequently.  In the US, hedge funds may be regulated by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various SROs and exchanges, state securities regulators, the Department of Labor and maybe others.  In addition to the Act, hedge funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act (for exclusion from the definition of an Investment Company) and the Securities Act of 1933 (Regulation D  concerning sales of private securities).  Any trading by direct investment hedge funds is subject to all the rules of FINRA and the exchanges.   

 If anything, regulation in the UK is even stricter.  Solid regimes exist in other jurisdictions, including Cayman and Bermuda. 

 In short, it is the case in the US and the UK, among other major venues, that hedge funds are (highly) regulated pools of capital. 

 I will propose changes to the article as time permits.   """

As yet, they are still a new, largely uncorroborated (recent popular reporting notwithstanding) theory, which may or may not turn out to work.  I take exception to being told to read Popper.  If you had actually read what I wrote above, you would have seen that I referred to black holes as being falsified: if this is not a direct reference to Popperian ideas then I do not know what is.  Nonetheless, Popper is by no means the last word on the matter.  I think the idea is weird and bizarre, personally, but I have seen how they seem to be a natural consequence of general relativity.  Anyway, black holes are a fact in as much as they drop out of relativistic equations.  They are real constructs, so to speak, which may or may not exist """"out there"""".  The article makes it clear that no-one has found something that is definitely a black hole, etc. etc.  But black holes, as theoretical constructs, do have certain properties, and the article describes those: same as the MECO article describes various properties that a MECO, as a theoretical construct, would have.  Why are black holes junk science, though?  I never knew they were tools of political manipulation or anything like that!  
 ::::More importantly, what specifically in the article needs changing? Also, since this article is in fairly good shape at the moment, are you able to help clean up the MECO article?  I have done a bit, but it needs a Hell of a lot of work.   """

That includes disclosure of any account used to make an edit from that point forward, as per the condition set within the original ban regarding the condition for unbanning. Disclosure will take place in full adherence to the COI Guidelines. Prior to the ban it was our opinion that it was unclear whether or not COI disclosure was mandatory, and if it had been made known to us that it was mandatory and not an issue for debate, we would never have made previous edits contrary to the guidelines. Now that we know disclosure is mandatory, we have altered our practices to adhere to the new set of rules. I have reviewed the above proposals for how new forms of COI declarations could occur, and state here that WikiExperts is fully willing to work directly with the Community to develop a system of declarations that makes the Community comfortable and provides an additional level of neutral scrutiny for all our contributions. We will not be posting, and have not posted in the past, anything that is/was not meant to help develop a more accurate and better Wikipedia, and we are comfortable working with the Community to prove our work can be beneficial to Wikipedia. Because of previously signed NDAs, we have no ability to reveal the past clients, however, we pledge to no longer sign agreements that would disallow us from full COI disclosure, so that all future work can be verified as within Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The Ethics page on our website already states as such, and past references to confidentiality of the service have been removed. We would very much like to prove that we are not harmful to Wikipedia, and to show that we add neither promotional nor non-notable material to the website when allowed to edit.
